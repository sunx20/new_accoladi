		<h2 class="article-sub-title" >Get Noticed for Your Talent</h2>
		<p>As we have talked about in past blogs, competitions are a great way to build your resume and bolster your college applications, whether you play <a target="_new" href="https://www.accoladi.com/contest-to-impress-trumpet/" >trumpet</a>, <a target="_new" href="https://www.accoladi.com/contest-to-impress-flute/" >flute,</a> or <a target="_new" href="https://www.accoladi.com/contest-to-impress-vocal/" >sing</a>. Competing shows recruiters your commitment to enhancing your talent.</p>
		<p>You may already be involved in a school choir, band, orchestra, extra-curricular ensemble, or musical. However, when many students are already involved in these activities, it can be hard to stand out against the crowd. The next step to get noticed by colleges is participating in competitions.</p>
		<p>There are benefits to competitions beyond increasing your chances of college recruitment.</p>

			<li>Being presented with the chance to experience working with professional musicians.</li>
