		<p>You want to major or minor in music and not English so why is writing an essay such an essential portion of the collegiate application form? Moreover, majoring or minoring in music often requires a separate essay from the one the general application requires: what is this all about? It is just this simple, the college/university/conservatory wants to get to know you, and wants to know if you know yourself and your personal goals well enough to express them. And for you the applicant, this is your one and best opportunity to share your voice, your unique experiences, and your perspective. Remember, the collegiate admission process is a highly competitive one and the college, as well as the music department, is seeking out those students they feel have the best grasp of themselves and their career goals. Admission counselors for the school and the music department are looking for the same thing, a prospective student who will become a graduate. Basically, collegiate admissions counselors believe the essay is one of their best ways to evaluate the student’s potential for completing their degree program. </p>
		<p>Whether you are writing your essay for the general application or for the secondary application for the music department, the following are some general guidelines for creating each designated essay:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Do not write the same essay for the general school admission application and the music department secondary application. These essays are for two separate purposes. These admissions counselors are always speaking to each other, and it can almost be guaranteed they will check the applications for duplicated essays. Take this solid advice – do not copy and paste the same essay for the two different applications.
				<ul>
					<li>The essay for the general application should describe what makes you unique and differentiates you from other potential students. This essay should tell college admissions officers something they don’t already know about you. The first sentence should be creative and should compel the reader to want to get to know you better.</li>
					<li>The essay for the secondary application for the music department should outline not only what makes you unique, but also the qualities which will make you a good ensemble member. You should describe all of the creative skills and talents you possess that are in addition to your main field of study or declared major. Remember these reviewers are considering if this person will make a life-long colleague in the specific field of study.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Do not plagiarize your essay. You will find numerous excellent examples of collegiate essays on the internet. They should be seen as guides as to what you will write, but nothing more than guides. I promise you, admissions counselors also know how to google, and they know the popular essays that have been posted. They are keenly aware when they reappear on a student’s application.</li>
			<li>Even though the general admission application has no strict word count, it is widely suggested a cap of about 650 words while some admission counselors suggest 800 words. However, when it comes to the music department secondary application essay it should be much shorter. The rule of thumb on word count for this essay is 250 to 350 words.</li>
			<li>Plan on two months of writing and editing your essay before submitting it as a part of the application. This would apply to both the general application and the music department’s secondary application. Both should be given equal weight in the writing and editing stage. Yes, editing is the key word: remember, the best writing is rewriting. Have a group of individuals ready to review and edit your writing. Experts in the field are recommended, if possible. While there are individuals and companies that offer paid essay help - from editing services to essay-writing boot camps - it is the consensus of admission counselors that individuals who know you will always make the best editors.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Let’s not forget that the application has many parts. This is true of both the general admission application and the secondary music department application. Here is a slice of wisdom when it comes to understanding the relationship of the essay to the overall application: the essay is the window, but the application is the house. Windows come in different shapes and sizes and are decorated in many different styles. Thus, the foundation of the house must be strong, and the window must be inviting.</p>
		<h3>The following is a student’s sample essay at lengths of 250 words, 500 words, and 750 words for a music department’s secondary application:</h3>
		<p><b>Jim Kross, Holdrege, Nebraska – Saxophone / Major in Saxophone Performance</b></p>
		<p><b>Example: 250 words</b></p>
		<p>Hard work has been a central theme my whole life. My parents are fourth-generation farmers in Holdrege, Nebraska, and it was on the farm where I first learned the value of hard work. I brought this work ethic with me when I started playing saxophone in the sixth-grade band.</p>
		<p>By the end of my seventh-grade year, I knew that I wanted to do something with music. During All-State week in my 8th-grade year, I heard the US Army Band perform, and it was the most beautiful performance I had ever heard. From then on, I have been determined to play in that band. However, the odds of making the band were better as a clarinet player than a saxophone player, so that summer, I decided to learn to play the clarinet. My parents could not afford private clarinet lessons. Because of this, I listened to lessons on YouTube, and I worked all summer to learn to play the clarinet. This hard work paid off when I made the Nebraska All-State Band three years in a row. </p>
		<p>Because of the financial strain college would be on my family, I understood that I would need to work extremely hard so that I could earn scholarships to afford a college education and then play in the US Army Band. I will take this value of hard work and will be an asset in whatever I do so that I can represent my community, my family, and myself well and instill the value of hard work in others.</p>
		<p><b>Example: 500 words</b></p>
		<p>Hard work has been a central theme in my life. My parents are fourth-generation farmers in rural Holdrege, Nebraska, and it was on the farm where I first learned the value of hard work. In addition to work ethic, a love for music was instilled into me from an early age by my mother and aunts, who have an a cappella gospel trio. I brought this work ethic and love for music with me when I started playing saxophone in the sixth-grade band. Soon, my band director, Mr. Wise, recognized that I had a desire to excel and an ability to shape musical phrases and play in-tune. Mr. Wise helped build upon the foundation my family laid by teaching me good technique and helping me hone my abilities.</p>
		<p>By the end of my seventh-grade year, I knew that I wanted to do something with music. In the eight-grade, I made second-chair saxophone in Nebraska’s 8th Grade All-State Band. During All-State week at the University of Nebraska, I got to hear a performance of the United States Army Band. I had never heard anything so beautiful in my life, and my band director shared that playing in the Army Band was a full-time job and that they played all over the world. I then decided that I would someday be a member of this band. I also noticed that the band had only four saxophones and twenty-eight clarinets; the odds of making this band was better as a clarinet player than a saxophone player, so during the summer between middle school and high school, I learned to play the clarinet. </p>
		<p>My parents could not afford private clarinet lessons. Because of this, I began listening to lessons by different teachers on YouTube, and I worked hard all summer to learn how to play the clarinet. The next school year, I made the first section of the Nebraska All-State Band. In the 10th and 11th grade, I was first chair of the All-State Band, and I will be representing Nebraska in Macy’s All-American Band in Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade in New York this year. </p>
		<p>In my quest to someday be in the United States Army Band, I enrolled in Junior ROTC my sophomore year and now hold the rank of Sergeant Major. This gave me valuable leadership experience and directed the value of hard work toward serving others. As the first person in my family to ever consider attending college, I realized that going to college would be a financial strain on my family. Because of this, I understood that I would need to work extremely hard so that I could earn scholarships to afford a college education. I will take this value of hard work and will be an asset wherever I go so that I can represent my community, my family, and myself well and instill the value of hard work in others.</p>
		<p><b>Example: 750 words</b></p>
		<p>Hard work! That is how I have been raised - understanding the importance of hard work. My family is the fourth generation to make our living by farming in rural Holdrege, Nebraska. It was that work ethic that I brought with me when I started playing saxophone in the sixth-grade band. I had already been exposed to music since my mother and her two sisters have a gospel a capella trio, and they are always practicing at our house. My aunt always makes sure that they sing through the phrase, and my mother, who has perfect pitch, always makes sure that everyone is on pitch. Soon Mr. Wise, my band director, recognized that I had a desire to excel, and a natural ability to shape musical phrases and play in-tune. He took the talent and exposure to music I had and taught me techniques that developed my abilities.</p>
		<p>By the end of my seventh-grade year, I knew that I wanted to do something with music. In the eight-grade, I made second-chair saxophone in Nebraska’s 8th Grade All-State Band. I did this without private lessons, only with help from my band director and lots of hard work on scales, etudes, and required solo selections. During All-State week at the University of Nebraska at Kearney, I watched the United States Army Band perform. I had never heard anything sound so great in my life, and my band director shared that playing in the army band was a full-time job and they played all over the United States and the world. I decided then that someday I would be a member of this band. I also noticed that the band had only four saxophones and twenty-eight clarinets; the odds of making this band was better as a clarinet player than a saxophone player, so that summer, I learned to play the clarinet. </p>
		<p>My parents could not afford private clarinet lessons for me because it would mean that we would have to travel to the University of Nebraska in Kearney, and that would mean a day away from the farm each week, as well as the monetary expense of the lessons. So, I began listening to lessons by teachers on YouTube, and I especially listened to concert clarinetist Martin Frost and tried to imitate his sound and technique. As a result of my determination and hard work, I made the first section of Nebraska All-State Band in the 9th grade. In the 10th and 11th grade, I was first chair. This year, I am representing Nebraska in Macy’s All-American Band in Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade in New York City.</p>
		<p>In my quest to someday be in the United States Army Band, I enrolled in Junior ROTC my sophomore year and now hold the rank of Sergeant Major. I have earned good grades in all college prep classes and AP classes, and I rank 2nd now in my graduating class, resulting in me being a member of the National Honor Society and the Beta Club. I am also a member of Future Farmers of America and Vice-President of Student Government. Music is my passion, and I have also been a member of our showchoir and the Vocal Jazz Ensemble. All of these experiences have given me valuable experiences and have reinforced the value of hard work in every aspect of my life.</p>
		<p>It is my desire to go to a college or university and major in clarinet performance. I am excited to participate in any ensemble and become part of the campus community. As the first person in my family to ever consider attending college, I realized that going to college would be a financial strain on my family. Because of this, I understood that I would need to work extremely hard so that I could earn scholarships to afford a college education. I will take this value of hard work and will be an asset wherever I go so that I can represent my community, my family, and myself well and instill the value of hard work in others.</p>
