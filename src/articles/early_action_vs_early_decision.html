		<h2 class="article-sub-title">Can it Work for a Music Major?</h2>
		<p>During the college admissions process you will encounter the terms “Early Action” and “Early Decision”. While they seem similar, they refer to entirely different processes and results, particularly for potential music majors. </p>
		<h3> General Understanding</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Both Early Action and Early Decision have earlier application deadlines than regular admissions.</li>
			<li>When you apply with Early Action and Early Decision you will receive college admissions decisions earlier, beginning in mid-December.</li>
			<li>Using Early Action you can apply to as many schools as you want.</li>
			<li>Early Decision is a binding agreement between you and one school only. If you are accepted, you must attend this school.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>So, you can see that while their names are similar, the process and outcome of each is quite different. A clear understanding of the difference between the two is essential when making your admissions choices.</p>
		<h3>What is Early Action?</h3>
		<p>As the name implies, Early Action college applications will be due earlier than regular applications. Typical deadlines for regular applications can be December 1 and January 15, whereas early deadline submissions become due beginning as early as mid-October. </p>
		<p>There is no limit to the number of schools to which you can apply using Early Action. This allows you to submit your applications weeks before everyone else.</p>
		<p>This makes Early Action a great option because, according to the National Association for College Admission Counseling (NACAC), “<i>students apply early and receive a decision well in advance of the institution’s regular response date</i>.” You will receive your admissions decisions earlier and allow you additional months to make your collegiate plans. </p>
		<p>Another great advantage with Early Action is that you do not need to commit until May 1 (the national response date), giving you critical time to compare financial aid packages and make your decision. </p>
		<p>There is a major drawback for the potential music major. Early Action can only be completed if you have been through the audition process and for the most part, potential music majors are not offered an early audition. As a result, if you plan to be a music major it is generally impossible to participate in Early Action. </p>
		<h3>What is Early Decision?</h3>
		<p>Unlike Early Action, Early Decision is binding! You can apply to only one school because you are saying that if the school accepts you, you will absolutely attend. Because of this commitment, colleges require signatures from you, your family, and a school counselor before you apply to Early Decision.</p>
		<p>Early Decision best benefits you if you know without question your first-choice college and you are confident of your odds of getting accepted. Similar to Early Action, you will also receive an admissions decision early, usually in December.</p>
		<p>One of the challenges of Early Decision can be that you will not find out about other schools until later in the year. If you get accepted by a different school, and you change your mind about your Early Decision school, you don’t have the option to switch. So be 100% certain about your Early Decision school. If you are torn on which school(s) you would ultimately like to attend, Early Decision is not be the best choice for you.</p>
		<p>Another aspect of Early Decision is the financial side. Schools are less likely to offer you a general academic or leadership scholarship because they know you have already committed to attend their school if admitted. </p>
		<p>However, more and more music departments in need of certain instrumentalist (clarinets, oboes, bassoons, euphoniums, tubas, violas, and double basses) and certain voice parts (countertenors and basses) will set up private Early Decision auditions and entrance exams. In fact, some colleges and universities have an audition date preset for students entering the Early Decision process. </p>
		<p>And if you do a stellar job as a much-needed instrumentalist or vocalist, music departments will give you strong scholarship consideration. So, you will have to investigate each college and music department to determine their financial aid incentive policies for Early Decision candidates. Compare the potential lack of general academic scholarships to the potential music department scholarships to determine the amount of financial aid available.</p>
		<h3>Should I Apply Early?</h3>
		<p>Applying early can alleviates the stress that comes with the more protracted traditional admissions. Early Action allows you until May 1 to decide on the school you want to attend, although, this may not be the most strategic plan for a potential music major. Both Early Action and Early Decision show that you have done your research and are interested in their school(s). But remember, if you are a music major considering Early Action or Early Decision, you must complete your audition material and financial applications by October of your senior year. Also, if a school does not schedule early admission auditions, you may need to be strongly proactive in scheduling your early date. Be flexible with the audition date they give you. Don’t schedule an early audition and cancel at the last minute because you need more time to prepare. This sends a wrong message to the music department. </p>
		<p>With all the advantages, it may seem compelling to apply early. The early admissions process will work best for you if you are sure of your dream school(s) and feel you are a competitive applicant. Make sure you are prepared both financially and mentally to commit to that school before you begin the process.</p>
		<p>Most importantly, do your research! </p>
