			A famous instructor at one of America&rsquo;s
			renowned conservatories was once asked by a student during a campus
			visit of prospective students, &ldquo;Why is sightreading such an
			important aspect of the audition?&rdquo; The seasoned instructor
			leaned back against her piano and said, &ldquo;Sightreading tells
			your musical story. In fact, it actually tells your personal story.&rdquo;
		</P>

		<P>
			&ldquo;First and foremost,&rdquo; she
			continued, &ldquo;sightreading tells us without question the level of
			your musical proficiency. It tell us if you can equally divide rhythm
			from pitch and if you have the technical ability to bring these two
			together in a musical expression. It also tells us if you have a
			grasp of the stylistic performance practices encapsulated in the
			major divisions of music history.  It tells us your command of your
			voice or instrument.  And most importantly it tells us if you have
			the basic musical aptitude for in-depth musical instruction that
			enables us as instructors to dig deep into the musical expressiveness
			of the composition and bring out of you future memorable musical
			performances on a consistent basis.
		</P>

		<P>
			Sightreading tells us about you
			personally.  Are you a person gripped by fear or do you have the
			inner strength to control your fear? Are you disciplined?  Have you
			spent the necessary time in the practice room to show yourself
			capable of performing your craft at only a moment&rsquo;s notice?  We
			are all human, people get sick, and death occurs as a part of life.
			As a future professional performer, can you step in and cover the
			part for that sick, or even worse, dead person?  Are you a person
			that perseveres or a person that makes excuses? Inevitably, you are
			going to make mistakes when sightreading&mdash;we all do&mdash;but
			are you going to push through, not lose the beat, grab as many notes
			as possible, and will the ones you do play be played with musical
			expression?  Or are you the person that is going to stop and make
			excuses for your mishaps? Are you the person whose frustration will
			run so high that even the smallest mistake will cause you to throw
			your music in your backpack and walk away?
		</P>

		<P>
			Being a professional musician, whether
			as a performer, conductor, or educator, means you have  enough
			applicable knowledge about music in a general sense and the command
			of your instrument or voice to deliver a worthy performance or
			product.  And you personally have the confidence and inner strength
			to face any challenge.  So, as I said, sightreading tells your
			musical story. In fact, it actually tells your personal story.
			Actually, it tells your complete story. And it&rsquo;s the &lsquo;complete
			you&rsquo; that&rsquo;s auditioning, and the &lsquo;complete you&rsquo;
			that may be accepted, and the &lsquo;complete you&rsquo; we believe
			can have a significant influence and partnership with us.
		</P>

		<P>
			That&rsquo;s why sightreading is both
			important and essential in getting to know you.
