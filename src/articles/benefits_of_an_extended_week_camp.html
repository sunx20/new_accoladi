		<p>In America each summer there are thousands of music camps, enrichment experiences, master
		classes, intensives, and summer stocks. These experiences are primarily sponsored by college
		and universities and held on-campus. Usually, no audition is required for acceptance, admission
		is granted upon application and payment of associated fees. The roles of administrator,
		ensemble director, theory professor, and private lesson instructors for each instrument or voice
		part are assumed by the same university faculty you will encounter during the academic year.
		These camps usually go for one week, sometimes two, and conclude with a large, ensemble
		concert. The number one purpose of these on-campus camps is exposure to the college or
		university and their recruitment efforts. Yes, you are paying for their recruiting opportunity.
		These camps have their place and are very positive experiences for many students.</p>

		<p>There is another set of camps that are extended week camps and most often held in privately
		owned facilities. These camps can be sponsored by, and held on the campus of, a private
		foundation, a professional performing organization or a controlling music association for 3 to 5
		weeks…sometimes even up to 7 weeks. These student campers must apply and attend a live
		audition or submit an online video audition. Traditionally they come from across America, or
		often from foreign counties, and they have demonstrated a certain level of performance
		proficiency in order to even be consider for this opportunity. The faculty and directors of these
		camps come from the most renewed professional performing organizations in America and the
		world. They have been well vetted before they are selected to serve in their perspective roles
		and are renowned in their field. The campers experience here is more individually focused with
		intensive instruction in private studio lessons and music theory advancing each student’s
		progress personally. These campers will perform in large and small chamber ensembles, as well
		as soloists.</p>

		<p>Attendance at one of these extended-week camps gives the campers numerous advantages in
		collegiate selection consideration on most campuses. First and foremost, music department
		recruiters parallel these camps with the actual collegiate experience. These campers have had
		to apply and audition for their spot from a pool of excellent student performers from their own
		town, state and all across the United States and the world. In order to be considered, they had
		to follow specific performance audition requirements and take a music theory placement test, a
		personal interview and supply references. This mirrors the collegiate application and audition
		process. Secondly, these student campers must learn to assimilate themselves into a well-
		defined culture historically noted for its excellent individual lesson, practice, recital and
		performance rigors. These campers will quickly discover whether they will sink or swim in this
		environment. Third, there is daily competition among the campers for performance
		opportunities, recognition in theory and composition, and leadership roles in chamber
		ensembles. These defining aspects inspire these campers to demonstrate their capacity for
		excellence and this creates prime candidates for acceptance in any collegiate institution.</p>

		<p>Other advantages of attending an extended week camp.
			<ul>
				<li>
					These camps are highly scouted by schools of music recruiters and most have a college
					fair day or weekend for personal interchanges between the camper, the camper’s family
					and the institutions represented.
				</li>
				<li>
					Because of their extended time together these campers and faculty will have an
					opportunity to get to know each other on a deeper level. Campers can establish
					relationships with faculty members who represent their colleges, universities or
					conservatories across the country and globe. This gives the camper the opportunity to
					be on a recruiting track before senior year. Research reveals that the campers at these
					denoted camps are some of the first recruited applicants in America and historically
					receive greater consideration for institutional scholarships. Research from a leading
					Midwest university found that the campers who attended any one of these prestigious
					camps received an average 68% reduction in tuition and room and board all four years
					of the collegiate experience. Admittedly, attending one of these extended camps can be
					expensive but it is like investing money in a fast-earning CD that can be cashed in when
					the college experience begins.
