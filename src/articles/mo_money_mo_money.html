		<h3>NCAA Rules Apply to Athletes Only</h3>
		<P>
			If you look at a football stadium on
			a Saturday afternoon, it&rsquo;s hard to believe that there are more
			performing arts scholarships than athletic scholarships. How can it
			even be possible? It is because of the rules. Student athletes have a
			restriction that performing arts students do not: student athletes
			are bound by NCAA rules:
		</P>
		<UL>
			<LI><P>NCAA rules determine how much
			scholarship money a student athlete can get. The amount is based on
			the college&rsquo;s NCAA division and the student&rsquo;s sport.</P>
			<LI><P>Student athletes can only
			accept scholarships from their school. If they take scholarship
			money from anywhere else, they can be disqualified.</P>
			<LI><P>The NCAA allows general
			academic scholarships for student athletes. About 32% of student
			athletes are eligible to receive these.</P>
		</UL>
		
		<h3>Non-Institutional (third-party) Scholarships are Key</h3>
		<P>
			Performing Arts students don&rsquo;t
			have a governing body. That means they can receive scholarships from
			their school and from non-school sources. A non-school source is also
			called a non-institutional (third-party) source. It is a group that
			is not part of a college or university. Some examples are The
			American Viola Society and the Nashville Opera Guild.
		</P>
		
		<P>Some other examples of non-institutional (third-party) scholarships are:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>The John Philip Sousa Foundation Hawkins Memorial Scholarship<</LI>
			<LI>The National YoungArts Foundation U.S. Presidential Scholarship<</LI>
			<LI>Music for All Foundation Scholarships<</LI>
		</UL>
		<P>
			Unlike student athletes, performing
			arts students can get scholarships through all levels of their
			education, even if they decide to get a doctoral degree.
		</P>
		
		<h3>Performing Arts Students get More Scholarship Money</h3>
		<P>
			There are six performing arts
			students for each athletic student on U.S. college campuses. In
			addition,&nbsp;<B>when performing arts students use all the resources
			available to them, they receive $7 in scholarship money for every $1
			student athletes receive from their institutional scholarships.&nbsp;</B>That
			means there is more than $5 billion in scholarship money available to
			performing arts students every year!
		</P>
		
		<P>
			Unlike their restricted athletic
			friends, performing arts students have a lot of freedom to find and
			accept scholarships from many sources. That freedom makes their
			college education more affordable and (because they are making music)
			more fun.
		</P>
