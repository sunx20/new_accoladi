		<h2 class="article-sub-title" >Be as Involved as Football Parents</h2>
		<p>Parents, let’s talk about our counterparts, football parents. We heard from an NCAA Division I football recruiter that football parents who act as an agent for their son give their kid an advantage. As a result, these kids tend to be signed to better schools and with more scholarship money. In sports, parent involvement is expected and appreciated.</p>
		<p>So, what does parent involvement look like on the football side? Highly involved football parents tend to know these three things:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The top 25 Associated Press college rankings and schools have been at the top for the last five years.</li>
			<li>The names and biographies of the head coaches they are targeting. They often know the names and biographies of the rest of the coaching staff and trainers.</li>
			<li>They know which teams and coaches develop NFL players.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>As a music parent, do you have the same skills?</p>
		<p><b>Here’s a place to start</b>: the top 25 music programs in the country are not all at universities. They are at:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Conservatories</li>
			<li>Schools of music</li>
			<li>Institutes</li>
			<li>Colleges</li>
			<li>Universities</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>In my next post, I’ll explain the differences between these types of institutions.</p>
		<p><b>If you’re serious about helping your student get a music scholarship, here’s your homework:</b></p>
		<ol>
			<li>Name the top 25 collegiate music programs in the country.</li>
			<li>For your student’s top picks, know the Dean of the program and his or her history. What are the names and biographies of the large ensemble directors? The major applied professors?</li>
			<li>Of the top 25 schools and directors, which consistently have graduates performing in major orchestras, military ensembles, Broadway shows, solo commercial projects, or auditioning for world-class productions?</li>
		</ol>
