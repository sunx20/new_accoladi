		<P>When it comes to higher education, undergraduate music majors have numerous choices:</P>

		<UL>
			<LI><B>Attend a college with a music department.</B>
			 At a college, only undergraduate degrees are offered and within a
			music department the scope of the degree offerings is limited. This
			is because the makeup of a department is a close-knit environment,
			usually with faculty that teaches more than one subject, but all
			interrelated in the administrating of the undergraduate degree.
			Music departments are most often found in small liberal arts or
			church denominational colleges.  The degrees offered by college
			music departments are primarily Bachelor of Arts (BA) or a Bachelor
			of Science (BS). Both of these degrees are equally divided between
			general academic studies and specific music related courses.  The
			most often realized degrees from college music departments are in
			the area of music education, music ministry, performance and music
			business.</LI>

			<LI><B>Attend a college with a music conservatory.</B>
			A conservatory is a focused environment with a highly skilled faculty
			that is renowned in their field and teach only with the scope of
			their denoted discipline.  In a conservatory the vast
			majority (at least 95%) of the student&apos;s time will be devoted
			to music classes, studio lessons, performing, practicing, and
			composing (depending on major).  However, be it noted that this is a
			conservatory on a college campus and a college can only offer
			undergraduate degrees.  The degrees primarily offered at a college
			music conservatory are Bachelor of Music (BM) or a Bachelor of
			Musical Arts or Bachelor of Fine Arts in Music and/or a Performance
			Diploma.  The vast majority of college music conservatory students
			will pursue a career in performance, composition, or music.</LI>

			<LI><B>Attend a university with a School of Music</B>.
			Universities offer undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate
			degrees. A School of Music inside a university is very much like a
			conservatory with a denoted and varied faculty. The student will
			spend approximately 70% of their studies within the music field and
			the other 30% in general studies related to the prescribed music
			degree program. Although the undergraduate degrees are usually the
			same as a music department Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science,
			the emphasis of study is strong in a School of Music and the degree
			may read: Bachelor of Arts in Instrumental Music Education, Bachelor
			of Science in Music Therapy, or a Bachelor of Music in Jazz
			Performance.  The students graduating from a School of Music will
			have a myriad of opportunities to pursue: instrumental music
			education, choral music education, general music education, music
			business, music technology, music composition, music theory, music
			history, songwriting, music ministry, music and worship studies,
			musicology, ethnomusicology, and performance.</LI>

			<LI><B>Attend a university with a Music Conservatory</B>.
			Again, a music conservatory is a highly intense experience with the
			vast majority of courses in the discipline of music. The only
			difference between a college music conservatory and a university
			music conservatory is that the university music conservatory will
			have both undergraduates and graduate students pursuing the same
			ensemble performance opportunities.  The degree offerings are the
			same; however, historically the largest group of undergraduate
			students will be pursuing a degree in performance.</LI>

			<LI><B>Attend a Conservatory.</B> Conservatory
			training should be a major consideration for those students that are
			seeking to become a professional performer, conductor, or
			composer. More than 80% of the curriculum is dedicated to
			intense personal training and ensemble participation. Core
			courses outside of the anticipated professional role are limited and
			those that are offered are also focused on the professional desired
			career. These institutions most often have faculty whose
			primary careers are performing, conducting, and composing and they
			balance those careers with their conservatory teaching
			responsibilities. Thus, they are giving their students
			practical coaching based on their professional experiences. The
			student body size is limited to the most outstanding student
			performers that complete their studios and desired ensemble
			positions with most conservatories having fewer than 1,000
			students. The rigors of conservatory life are all
			consuming.</LI>
		</UL>

		<P>Each of the above has its advantages and the prospective student should
		consider future career desired, personal attitude towards competition
		 (the conservatory setting is an extremely competitive environment,
		as is the university where undergraduate students are competing with
		graduate students for the same opportunities), amount of music
		courses desired in comparison to general education courses, and the
		degrees required if a professional certification such as a teachers
		certificate is the end game.</P>
