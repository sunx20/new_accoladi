		<h2 class="article-sub-title">Your Audition Solor Performance</h2>
		<p>A repertoire of solo performance compositions is always required as a part of the audition. In fact, most recruiters will share that this is the most important aspect of the audition. This is where the auditioner can share his/her ability to musically interpret the composition as well as demonstrate his/her level of advanced technique. The selection of the solo repertoire should get the greatest attention of the auditioner in order to best demonstrate the totality of the young performer’s musicality, technical skills, and understanding of stylistic performance practices based on music history knowledge.</p>
		<p>Careful research must be done of the solo requirements of the institutions that the auditioner is most interested in. Many institutions will simply say two or three solos of contrasting styles. Other schools will be slightly more specific like two contrasting movements of a concerto or sonata from the Baroque or Classical period and one movement of a contrasting work of your choice. Some schools will be very specific in their solo requirements like the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Butler School of Music at the University of Texas</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Bb Clarinet <i>Mozart Clarinet Concerto in A major, K.622</i> – 1st movement a</li>
				<li>another piece of the applicant’s choosing from the standard grade six solo repertoire. </li>
			</ul>
			<li>Oberlin University and Conservatory for the Bb clarinet</li>
			<ul>
				<li><i>First Movement of Mozart’s Clarinet Concerto in A major, K622</i> </li>
				<li>Stravinsky’s Three Pieces for Solo Clarinet, Movement II </li>
			</ul>
			<li>Eastman School of Music for the Bb clarinet</li>
			<ul>
				<li><i>First Movement of the Mozart Concerto in A major, K,622 </i>(measure 57 to downbeat of measure 154) </li>
				<li>Debussy’s Premiere Rhapsodie or other French concours solo </li>
				<li>a solo work of the auditioner’s choice. </li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<p>Some institutes require the potential auditioner to denote their solo repertoire in the application for music department acceptance before an audition date and time is awarded to the applicant. For example, the Julliard School ‘s auditions requirements read “<i>As part of the online application, you are required to submit your proposed live audition repertoire for review. And insufficient or incomplete audition repertoire may affect consideration for admission. At the live audition at least one major solo of the applicant’s choice selected from the repertoire list provided. Must be performed from memory</i>.” </p>
		<p>Recruiters suggest that a student have a repertoire list with a minimum of seven solo compositions listed. Here are some guidelines for curating your repertoire list:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Have at least seven solo compositions prepared and listed:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Three of the compositions should be from the Barque and/or Classical periods </li>
				<li>One piece from the Romantic period </li>
				<li>One selection from the Impressionistic period</li>
				<li>Two compositions from the 20th – 21st Century.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>One multi-movement concerto and/or a sonata should round out your list</li>
		</ul>
		<p>As impressive as your list may look the most important aspect to remember is this list is more than a well-researched list it is a documentation of your performance abilities.</p>
		<p>Yes, you will want to comply to all the rules and requirements but most importantly you want to deliver the performance of a lifetime at your audition. So, you must be realistic about the music that you will play or sing at your audition. You may be tempted to perform a solo that may be too difficult for your present abilities. This is not a good idea. Your major work at this audition is to perform music well. Not to play or sing hard music. You must show off your best self, your most musical self.</p>
		<p>A less difficult selection of music played or sung extremely well, with confidence, is going to be impressive and by far will go over well with the audition panel. A more difficult piece of music that is played with errors, with little musical expression, is certainly not going to go over well. If you struggle with a piece technically, there won’t be any (or very little) musical expression. Most importantly, you want the audition panel to experience your musicianship. This is how you will wow the audition panel. Do not compromise on this. And you will soon be celebrating your admission and scholarships.</p>
