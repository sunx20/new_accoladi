		<P>
			The sightreading music
			just landed on your stand. You have about three minutes before you&rsquo;re
			expected to start playing. What are you going to do first? The first
			30 seconds after you get the music is the most critical to your
			success! Here&rsquo;s how you might want to spend them:
		</P>

		<OL>
			<LI>Read the title of the music, if there is one. The title can tell you the style, time period, or the general style of the music (e.g. March, Lullaby, Minuet).</LI>
			<LI>Look at the last note of the example. Are there any key changes within the piece? If not, the last note and the key signature should tell you the key of the composition, especially if it is in a major or minor key.</LI>
			<LI>Look at the tempo marking and get the speed in your head. Make 120 your &quot;tempo central.&quot; This is the speed of a march. You can adjust the tempo up or down if you have an internal &quot;tempo central.&rdquo;</LI>
			<LI>Look at the time signature and determine if you are in simple time or compound time. Check the composition for meter changes or mixed meter measures.</LI>
			<LI>Look for the compositional road-map. What are the signs? Things like repeat signs, D.S. al Fine, D.S. al Coda, Dal Segno.</LI>
		</OL>

		<P>
			After you&rsquo;ve
			completed your 5-step overview, you&rsquo;re ready to move on to part
			2: rhythm and pitch. In general, you can miss a pitch or two, but you
			cannot miss basic rhythm patterns.
		</P>

		<OL>
			<LI>You know if the composition is in simple or compound time and you&rsquo;ve found the mixed-meter measures. Concentrate on the transitional measures &mdash; two measures before and four measures into the meter change.</LI>
			<LI>Look for dotted and  tied notes. Count the measure before, the measure(s) with the dotted or tied notes, and two measures after for this pattern.</LI>
			<LI>Look for changes in tempo. This can be evident with a metronome meter marking or most often through musical terms. Count two measures before the tempo changes and two measures into the new tempo.</LI>
			<LI>Look for melodic patterns. The key here is patterns: if you get one pattern down, then you will have success with every consecutive pattern that imitates it.</LI>
			<LI>Look for large interval leaps. In general, if the interval is more than five lines or four spaces:</LI>
		</OL>

		<UL>
			<LI>Determine the interval distance</LI>
			<LI>Catalog the interval (e.g. M6, d7, P8)</LI>
			<LI>Sing (Solfege) three notes before the interval leap and three notes following the interval leap.</LI>
		</UL>

		<P>
			If you are accustomed to
			using the Eastman (Gordon) Method, with its rhythm counting patterns,
			hand movements and related syllables, use it as you review the
			sightreading passage. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to count out loud.
		</P>

		<P>
			When it comes to pitch
			reference using the Solfege system, softly sing the interval leaps.
			If you are accustomed to using Solfege hand signs do not be
			embarrassed to do this as well.
		</P>

		<P>
			The majority of
			adjudicators will be impressed that you have the knowledge and
			abilities to engage a systematic approach to rhythm and pitch as you
			prepare for your sightreading.
		</P>
