		<P>What are schools of
		music and music departments looking for in potential students? The
		trend is to look for more than just performers and future educators,
		they are looking for creators. It has become vividly clear over the
		past few years to music educators, choral directors, band directors,
		or orchestra directors as they have begun to incorporate arranging
		and songwriting in their curriculum from early grades through high
		school. In fact, several schools of music now offer scholarships to
		songwriters and even rappers because they believe these abilities
		could bring copyright and publishing royalties into the school&rsquo;s
		coffers. Several universities stated that advanced placement theory
		credits are weighted less in their admission decision process than
		the student who can write a song, especially a song following proper
		song structure. Also, many schools of music recruiters are looking
		for music students that have an entrepreneurial mindset. There are
		over 20 colleges or universities offering an undergraduate degree in
		Music Entrepreneurship.</P>

		<P>Music departments have
		realized the U.S. media and entertainment industry is the largest in
		the world. At over 20 billion in 2020, music represents slightly over
		1/3 of the global media and entertainment that includes motion
		pictures, television programs and commercials, broadcasts, radio,
		video games, and ancillary services and products. And there is no
		part of the entertainment industry that does not employ music as a
		basic creative element.  In 2020, the entertainment industry was
		ranked 11<SUP>th</SUP> in the
		U.S. economy. Economists predict this industry will reach more than
		$27 billion by 2030.</P>

		<P>College administrators
		have seen this growth in the entertainment/music business sector and
		have realized they are educating future creative talent and they
		should be realizing their fair share of this growing market. And it
		should be never forgotten that colleges, universities, and
		conservatories are always desiring to make a profit.</P>

		<P>A growing trend among
		many music departments is having their own publishing companies and
		recording companies. They are publishing new music from professors,
		students, and alumni, as well as publishing educational research and
		curriculums. Music departments depend on tuition and student fees,
		lab fees, and tutoring fees, but they also sell services: master
		classes, camps, symposiums, and ensemble weekends.  As well as
		showcasing musical theatre and opera seniors in New York for talent
		agencies and producers, and instrumental seniors showcased before the
		American Symphony League.
		</P>

		<P>So, if a music recruiter can see additional talents and/or a keen sense for business
		then the applying student performer becomes a more sought-after
		candidate for admission. Take the time to read about the publishing
		and recording divisions within the music department of the college,
		university, or conservatory you are most interested in, and make sure
		you express your interest in participating in these areas of their
		department: this could be your winning ticket to admission.</P>
