		<h3>The Unexpected Costs of Performing Arts in College</h3>
		<P>Whether your student is a performing
		arts major or is only going to participate in ensembles at college,
		there could be unexpected costs.</P>

		<h3>Surprises That Can Hurt Your Wallet</h3>
		<P>Your student is accepted into the
		college of their dreams. They received scholarships and a decent
		financial aid package. You have the invoice for the first semester
		and feel good about the balance of tuition, fees, books, room, and
		board. Except for some out-of-pocket money, your student is all set,
		right? Perhaps not.</P>

		<h3>The High Unexpected Costs of Performances</h3>
		<P>Whether your student is a performing
		arts major or is only participating in college ensembles, you might
		be in for some financial surprises. Your student could call you to
		tell you they need private lessons, suits, gowns, costumes, wigs,
		shoes, or travel expenses. But how much could these additional items
		cost?</P>

		<UL>
			<LI>Students can expect to pay on average $2,000 a year for their three performance gowns</LI>
			<LI>A 45-minute private lesson at a prestigious southern university is $260</LI>
			<LI>A Midwestern school requires its orchestra to travel and give performances during the summer. Students are responsible for all travel, lodging, and meals while on tour</LI>
			<LI>If you see a marching band using silver instruments and your student has a gold-toned instrument, they will need to replace it with a silver one to march with the band</LI>
			<LI>Voice students need language, diction, and vocal lessons</LI>
			<LI>Music education students need a quality baton</LI>
		</UL>

		<P>In high school, the school or the
		booster club provides all students an equal opportunity to
		participate in performing arts. In college, there is no booster club.
		These are not optional costs; they are part of the degree plan. If
		your student does not get the needed lessons, materials, or
		instruments, they could be removed from their programs or ensemble.</P>

		<h3>Strategies to Help Plan Ahead</h3>
		<P>Understand the college program catalog.
		The catalog is a legal document and explains nearly all costs related
		to your student&rsquo;s attendance and participation in performance
		ensembles. The college catalog is almost always online. If the
		catalog is not on the website, call the department office and ask for
		a copy. Some colleges might only offer their catalog to accepted
		students.</P>

		<P>Ask questions and be mindful of
		additional costs. Speak with ensemble directors and studio
		instructors about fees not listed online. Look at the
		semester-by-semester schedule to help you organize your questions.
		When a fee is not included in a catalog, consider negotiating.</P>

		<h3>Negotiate Unexpected Costs</h3>
		<P>If the clarinet teacher shares that he
		or she will only teach students that have a Buffet Crampon R13 Bb
		Clarinet and also requires a Buffet Crampon R13 A Clarinet. You might
		negotiate to let your child use the Buffet Crampon BC123150 R13
		Series A Clarinet which is less than half the price.</P>

		<P>The voice teacher requires that you
		make two trips to New York and one to Chicago to see three operas,
		two at the New York Met and one at the Chicago Lyric. These three
		trips for the semester could cost over $6,000. Negotiate one to New
		York and one to Chicago and then one in a 1/2 day driving distance
		like Atlanta or Houston.</P>

		<P>If you find that these costs of college
		might put your child&rsquo;s education out of reach, look into
		non-institutional (third-party) scholarships. Most communities have
		several scholarships available for local students. Great places to
		start are your student&rsquo;s high school guidance office or your
		local library. Both typically carry listings of scholarship
		opportunities.
		</P>

		<P>College is expensive, but knowing
		unexpected college costs upfront will help you plan and make paying
		for college more manageable.</P>
