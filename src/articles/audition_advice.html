				<p>If you answered D to all three questions, you scored 100.  If you did, you probably had to google all the institutions and their audition requirements to find the answer or you made your best educated guess.  When it comes to one of the most defining decisions of your life, there should be no guessing.  Offering a central location for general audition advice, as well as specific audition requirements for collegiate institutions, are just some of the many benefits of Accoladi.</p>
