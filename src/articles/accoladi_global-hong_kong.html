		<P>Overview</P>
		<P>If you are looking to attend college in a large and diverse city, Hong
		Kong could be a viable option for you. English is seen as a co-first
		language in the eyes of Hong Kong's education system, so all of the
		lectures at most universities are given in English. Campus life in
		Hong Kong is comparable to that of American universities, and
		non-local students have several resources to help make them feel more
		at home. Attending a university in Hong Kong could be a
		transformative experience in one's life, but how much would it cost
		to spend four years overseas?</P>


		<P>Luckily, Hong Kong universities are comparable in cost to American public
		universities and in many cases, are even cheaper.&nbsp; To combat the
		price of tuition and living expenses for international students, the
		Government of Hong Kong has set up the Government Scholarship Fund.
		This fund offers foreign students $10,300 USD per year, covering many
		expenses and making Hong Kong universities more affordable for
		international students. More information on this scholarship can be
		found here: <a target="_new" href="https://www.edb.gov.hk/en/edu-system/postsecondary/local-higher-edu/publicly-funded-programmmes/scholarship.html" target="_new" ><U>HKSAR
		Government Scholarship Fund</U></A>.</P>

		<P>Visa Requirements</P>
		<P>To study in Hong Kong, you will need to obtain a student visa. Unlike
		most countries, you are not required to have health insurance in
		order to obtain a Hong Kong student visa, but some institutions may
		require you to be covered.&nbsp; Additionally, the &ldquo;sponsor&rdquo;
		requirement can be fulfilled by your institution rather than a local
		individual.&nbsp; However, you must show that you are able to
		financially support yourself while you study in Hong Kong without
		having to work a job.&nbsp; This can include bank statements, cash on
		hand, traveler&rsquo;s cheques, credit cards, scholarships, etc. You
		also must pay a $30 visa application fee.&nbsp; The processing time
		for a Hong Kong student visa is 6 weeks, but some institutions
		recommend that you complete the process through the institution
		itself so that the processing time can be shortened.&nbsp; You can
		visit <a target="_new" href="https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/visas/study.html#secondTab" target="_new" ><U>Students
		| Immigration Department (immd.gov.hk)</U></A>
		for more information on the process of attaining a study visa to Hong
		Kong.</P>

		<P>Hong Kong Compared to US Colleges</P>

		<P>Hong Kong Baptist University vs Belmont University</P>
		<P>Both Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) and Belmont University have
		comprehensive music programs and are around the same size.&nbsp; At
		HKBU, students can take one of three pathways toward their bachelor&rsquo;s
		degree.&nbsp; The first is the BA in Music; under this program,
		students earn a BA in four years and choose one of the following for
		a concentration: composition/music production, performance/pedagogy,
		directed studies, or music education.&nbsp; The second is the BM in
		Creative Industries program, where students earn their degree in four
		years and choose either Scoring for Film, Television, and Video
		Games, or Popular Music Performance and Songwriting as a
		concentration.&nbsp; The third path is pursuing an Associate&rsquo;s
		Degree in Music Studies in 2 years and afterward pursuing a BA in
		Music Studies in an additional 2 years.&nbsp; The AD/BA degree path
		is a more generalized curriculum than the specialized BA in Music and
		BM in Creative Industries.&nbsp; HKBU also offers a plethora of
		performing opportunities through its many vocal and instrumental
		ensembles.</P>

		<P>Similar to HKBU, Belmont offers a choice between a BA in Music and a BM.&nbsp;
		For Belmont&rsquo;s BA in Music, students receive broad training in
		Classical music and combine this with another field by choosing a
		minor in any of Belmont&rsquo;s other BA fields.&nbsp; Additionally,
		students in this BA program will study an instrument of their
		choice.&nbsp; The second option is Belmont&rsquo;s BM degree
		program.&nbsp; At Belmont, students can earn a BM in Church Music,
		Commercial Music, Composition, Music Education, Music Performance,
		Music Technology, Music Theory, Music Therapy, Music Theory, Musical
		Theatre, or Piano Pedagogy.&nbsp; Belmont also offers oodles of
		performance opportunities in its many ensembles.</P>

		<P>Overall, HKBU and Belmont offer similar programs and opportunities with
		Belmont offering more specialized degree programs.&nbsp; However,
		they differ greatly in terms of cost.&nbsp; Belmont has an annual
		tuition of $38,430, with an estimated total annual cost (including
		room, board, books, travel, meals, and personal expenses) of
		$54,670.&nbsp; HKBU, on the other hand, charges $18,032 annually for
		tuition, bringing the total annual cost to $25,462, before
		scholarships and financial aid.</P>

		<P>University of Hong Kong vs Chapman University</P>
		<P>Chapman University, located in Orange, CA, and the University of Hong Kong
		(HKU)&nbsp; are comparable both in terms of size and musical
		programs.&nbsp; At 7,500 and 9,000 undergraduates, respectively,
		these two institutions both have small but well-funded music schools
		and prioritize performance opportunities for music majors.</P>

		<P>Chapman University offers four degrees in music: BA in Music, Bachelor&rsquo;s
		of Music (Pre-Music Education Certification), BM in Composition, and
		BM in Performance.&nbsp; Chapman&rsquo;s BA in Music, like most
		institutions, offers a broad curriculum on music theory and history,
		but Chapman is intentional in its inclusion of ethnomusicology.&nbsp;
		The other three degrees offered are specifically designed for
		particular fields: music education, composition, and performance.&nbsp;
		Notably, the BM in Performance allows for students to have a
		concentration in conducting, which is a rarity in American bachelor&rsquo;s
		degree programs.</P>

		<P>HKU only offers a BA in Music with three options for concentrations.&nbsp;
		Despite this, HKU&rsquo;s department of music is seen as the best
		music school in all of Hong Kong. Their degree program covers all
		aspects of music to ensure that each student receives a well-rounded
		education and that their view on music is expanded as a whole. In
		addition to these general courses, the music department offers
		numerous courses that are specific to performance, and there is even
		a course specifically offered to international students for music
		performance.&nbsp; Additionally, HKU ranks in the top 100
		universities in the world, meaning that students attending HKU
		receive some of the best education in the world.</P>

		<P>Undoubtedly, Chapman and HKU are both quality universities that offer their
		students many opportunities to learn and demonstrate their learning.&nbsp;
		However, students will save money by attending HKU over a school like
		Chapman while receiving an as good or better education.&nbsp; Chapman
		University charges $58,250 in annual tuition with an estimated annual
		cost of $71,330.&nbsp; On the other hand, The University of Hong Kong
		charges $22,025 in annual tuition, bringing the annual cost to
		$32,327, and this doesn&rsquo;t even account for the many music
		scholarships that HKU awards, for which international students are
		eligible.</P>

		<P>Hong Kong Academy for the Performing Arts vs San Francisco Conservatory of Music</P>
		<P>Hong Kong Academy for the Performing Arts (HKAPA) and the San Francisco
		Conservatory of Music are both very small schools that focus solely
		on the performing arts, and both offer numerous degrees in those
		areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

		<P>HKAPA offers a unique slate of degree programs; they offer BM degrees, as
		well as BA&rsquo;s in Chinese Opera, Dance, Drama, Film &amp; TV, and
		Theatre &amp; Entertainment Arts.&nbsp; Further, BM students may
		major in performance of an instrument of their choice, Chinese Music,
		Composition &amp; Electronic Music, Keyboard, Strings, Vocal Studies,
		Woodwind, Brass, &amp; Percussion, and Academic Studies.&nbsp; San
		Francisco&rsquo;s curriculum is very similar, allowing students to
		major in performance, jazz and American music, and notably,
		conducting, among others.&nbsp; Overall, both offer phenomenal
		training in composition, performance, and musicology that will
		empower students to be successful musicians.</P>

		<P>Despite their similarity in curriculum and quality, HKAPA is far more
		affordable for the everyday American than San Francisco Conservatory
		of Music.&nbsp; While San Francisco charges $49,300 in annual
		tuition, HKAPA only charges $6,826, bringing the estimated total
		annual cost to be $76,675 and $17,208, respectively.</P>

		<P>Conclusion</P>
		<P>As the tables show, a music student can get a similar education to that
		of the United States in Hong Kong for less money.&nbsp; In addition,
		studying in Hong Kong will expose you to Chinese and Southeast Asian
		cultures and give you experiences you won&rsquo;t find in the United
		States.&nbsp; Furthermore, you can even study Chinese music at many
		of these institutions and gain a more in-depth perspective as a
		musician.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
