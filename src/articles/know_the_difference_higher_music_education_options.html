		<p>When it comes to higher education, music majors have three choices:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Attend a university with a School of Music</b>. Schools of Music offer undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate degrees. A college may have a strong music program, but they only offer an undergraduate degree.</li>
			<li><b>Attend a conservatory or institute</b>. Conservatories and institutes have the same curriculum format. However, institutes often require stronger piano proficiencies and offer more conducting internships.</li>
			<li><b>Attend a university that has a conservatory </b>inside its School of Music.<br>

		</ul>
		
		<h3>Universities with a School of Music</h3>
		<p>Large universities such as <a target="_new" href="https://music.utexas.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >The University of Texas at Austin</a> and the <a target="_new" href="http://smtd.umich.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >University of Michigan</a> have strong music departments with many undergraduate and post-graduate degrees. Undergraduates and post-graduates compete for seats in the same ensembles. In addition, graduate students get stronger applied instructors. There is a full general education track at these schools, so undergraduates take math, English, and science. Performances at Saturday football games make the university experience a six-day week.</p>
	
		<h3>Colleges with Music Departments</h3>
		<p>Colleges like <a target="_new" href="https://www.ithaca.edu/academics/school-music" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Ithaca College</a>, <a target="_new" href="http://www.luther.edu/music/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Luther College</a>, and <a target="_new" href="https://wp.stolaf.edu/music/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >St. Olaf College</a> are primarily private liberal arts colleges. Since this is a college, only undergraduate students are enrolled. Performance and Music Education are the primary music degrees bestowed here. Students here take general education classes to earn their degree. The students here tend to be less competitive than at a university or conservatory. The college experience is usually five days a week. Marching band (or pep band) is often offered as an elective.</p>
		
		<h3>Conservatories and Institutes</h3>
		<p>By contrast, small college level conservatories/institutes such as <a target="_new" href="https://www.curtis.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Curtis</a>, <a target="_new" href="https://www.juilliard.edu/music" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Julliard</a>, the <a target="_new" href="https://bostonconservatory.berklee.edu/music" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Boston Conservatory</a>, and the <a target="_new" href="https://sfcm.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >San Francisco Conservatory of Music</a> focus exclusively on the arts. There is a strong competitive nature among the students. In addition to general courses like music theory and music history, students take humanities and writing courses. Some conservatories offer foreign language and music business courses. If you think the college experience has to include sports, frat parties, and weekend excursions, you should not look at this type of school. The strong competitive nature and number of performances required at a conservatory make this experience a seven-day week.</p>
		
		<h3>Conservatory Inside School of Music</h3>
		<p>Finally, there are conservatories within the college music department or the universityâ€™s School of Music. <a target="_new" href="https://www.oberlin.edu/conservatory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Oberlin College</a> and <a target="_new" href="http://www.bard.edu/conservatory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Bard College</a> both have an undergraduate general music department and a conservatory track functioning in the same building. Other schools like <a target="_new" href="http://ccm.uc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Cincinnati University Conservatory of Music</a> and the <a target="_new" href="https://www.su.edu/conservatory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Shenandoah University Conservatory of Music</a> offer undergraduate and post-graduate courses.</p>
		<p>There are benefits to this option. Students can take electives from the general curriculum. They also have access to the traditional college experience with football and parties. However, many students struggle to balance these options with conservatory performance requirements. The struggle often results in a seven-day week.</p>

		<p>Compare the websites of the schools I mentioned to understand the differences. Even better, visit the campuses to see the pace and depth of their curriculums and degree requirements.</p>
