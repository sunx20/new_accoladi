		<P>Choosing a school of music or music department within a college, university, or
		conservatory can be a very intimidating task. There are so many
		important factors that need to be considered when you are trying to
		find the best music school. The collegiate music program you
		pick will have a lasting effect on your future career. While it may
		be fun to browse various schools, it is a decision that should be
		taken very seriously.</P>

		<P>So, to help you make a great decision on a program that fits you and your
		needs, here are five important factors that can help your
		selection process:</P>

		<UL>
			<LI>Location of College, University, Conservatory</LI>
			<LI>What Degrees are Offered</LI>
			<LI>Exceptional Faculty</LI>
			<LI>Performance Opportunities</LI>
			<LI>Successful Alumni</LI>

		<h3>Location of School</h3>

		<P>When choosing the college, university, or conservatory you hope to attend,
		it is important to keep in mind not only how the location will affect
		you during your time in school, but also your future career
		opportunities.</P>

		<P>Think of this in terms of connections. Is the city and/or state where
		the school is located in an area where you want your future career
		possibilities to be?</P>

		<P>Admittedly, your instructors likely have connections that extend beyond the city
		or state where your desired schools are. However, they are probably
		members of state associations, and they will be naturally connecting
		you to people and possibilities within their circle of influence.
		You should be asking yourself now if this is a city or state where
		you can see yourself living long-term.</P>

		<h3>What Degrees are Offered</h3>

		<P>If you are interested in music production, you should not choose a music
		school that only offers music education degrees. The same would
		be true if you want to study piano or keyboard and the music school
		you're looking at focuses more heavily on the technical side of
		music.</P>

		<P>Don't place your aspirations and passion into a music program that doesn't
		quite fit. Thoroughly read the music program&rsquo;s
		curriculum and decide for yourself if it perfectly encapsulates what you want to
		learn and affords you every advantage in moving you toward your
		career choice. Next, make sure you like your potential private
		teacher (review as much material about them as possible, especially
		on YouTube for their Master Classes or recitals), and make sure you
		have the opportunity to participate in the ensemble(s) that are
		significant to your career choice. Give special consideration to the
		exact degree(s) they are promising. Are they offering a Bachelor of
		Music, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, or a Performance
		Certificate?</P>

		<P>One more consideration: how long will it take you to complete your chosen
		degree at this institution? Will it require you to attend summer
		classes? Will it require you to go on tour, and if so, what will it
		cost you? Survey other students in the degree program and find out
		from them if the degree can be completed in the amount of time stated
		on their website and in their catalog.</P>

		<P>
		<B>Exceptional Faculty </h3>

		<P>It is crucial to your success as a musician, music educator, composer,
		and/or music producer to find a music school that has an exceptional
		faculty in your area of study. Getting into a school with
		accomplished and experienced faculty will be critical for your future
		career. </P>

		<P>These instructors will play a pivotal part in your music education and
		networking opportunities once you graduate. Most music colleges list
		their faculty on their website. Take some time to check out their
		bios, what they have accomplished, and if they are still working on
		projects or advanced degrees. You will want to pay special attention
		if, before they began working at this institution, they were working
		as a professional musician, composer, or some aspect in the music
		industry. Those with professional experience should be given a
		special look as they will bring a different aspect to their learning
		as well as a different set of connections to whom you may be
		introduced.</P>

		<h3>Performance Opportunities</h3>

		<P>If you are a performance major, singer, or want to study a particular
		instrument, it is critical to take time to research the types
		of performance opportunities offered, and what types of
		performances are required as a part of the degree you are
		considering. Another important factor if you are considering a
		university over a college is whether all the ensemble positions are
		filled with graduate students and upperclassmen undergraduates. You
		should question if you, as a freshman or sophomore, will have the
		opportunity to audition and secure a seat in one of these ensembles.</P>

		<P>Be very thorough when doing your research; you want to choose a music
		school that is going to provide the right opportunities for you to
		grow as a musician, conductor, engineer, or music producer.</P>


		<h3>Successful Alumni</h3>

		<P>You can argue that a music college's success is directly tied to the
		achievements of its alumni and students.</P>

		<P>A school of music can boast a fantastic program (and it very well
		could be!), but if the students that graduate never make a splash in
		their chosen careers, that is a problem. Don't pay much
		attention to the names; instead check out what they have done, what
		areas they have mastered, and what sort of career paths they have
		taken.</P>

		<P>That isn't to say that a music school needs to have worldwide superstars
		exit its doors. However, if there are a couple of schools of music
		that have caught your attention, take a peek at their alumni page (if
		they don&rsquo;t have an alumni page, that is a <I>major red flag).</I></P>

		<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

		<P>The decision of finding just the right fit is all about you. You must know what you
		want and what you&rsquo;re willing to accept within the structure of
		the degree you are seeking. The majority of collegiate-seeking
		students often only look within their state and/or within a 90-mile
		radius of their home hoping they will find the right fit close to
		home. Don&rsquo;t limit yourself; if the degree program is not in
		your state or within 90-miles of home, keep looking, and make all the
		United States your first option, or you may decide to look abroad.
		This is by far the first and most important decision of your young
		adult life and will affect the majority of your career opportunities
		for the rest of your life, so make the right decision for you no
		matter where it is. Remember, it is your decision and it&rsquo;s all
		about you!</P>
