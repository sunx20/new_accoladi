		<h2 class="article-sub-title">Understanding Music Degrees</h2>
		<p>When deciding on a career path in music, there are four different types of undergraduate degrees which can have music as its focus.</p>

		<h3>Bachelor of Music (BM)</h3>
		<p>The Bachelor of Music is the most common type of music degree. It’s this type of degree that is almost exclusively offered at conservatories and music departments at universities. Students who pursue this degree will expect to concentrate on performance, composition, and theory—yet this type of degree is available in almost any concentration depending on the institution.</p>
		<p>Some schools offer a Bachelor of Music in Music Theory, or in Music Production, for instance. Still, the main difference between a Bachelor of Music and any other type of degree is its concentration on music-related material. Students who pursue a Bachelor of Music will take less non-musical courses here than in other degree tracks.</p>

		<h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
		<p>In deciding to attend college internationally, make sure that you do your due-diligence. A college may be affordable, but is it accredited in the United States? Does it offer the program/courses you want to take? Does it have good performance opportunities? What are the application requirements? How do I get housing? These are the questions you need to ask yourself before the application process. Luckily, Accoladi.com has this information, making this information more accessible to students.</p>

		<h3>Obtain a Student Visa</h3>
		<p>The Bachelor of Arts (BA) is a generalized degree which offers an education that is usually not performance-focused, but there are exceptions to this rule.</p>
		<p>Perfect for students who want a well-rounded education, the BA in Arts is great for the following types of concentrations:</p>
		<p><i>Bachelor of Arts in Music</i> – A generalized degree which can encompass performance, but also music history, theory, and composition.</p>
		<p><i>Bachelor of Arts in Music with A Concentration</i> – These degrees offer more classes in a specific focus, often based on the goal of further study, or a career.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><i>Musicology</i> – The study of musical history, and its cultural and sociological implications</li>
			<li><i>Music Theory</i> – You learn the rules of music, with all its ins and outs</li>
			<li><i>Composition</i> – The art of composing music is your focus</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA)</h3>
		<p>Then, there is the Bachelor of Fine Arts. This degree is the realm where performance majors may study. Composition or theory majors can also obtain BFAs in Music for a deeper exploration into their craft, generally deeper than a Bachelor of Arts, but less than a Bachelor of Music.</p>
		<p>The most common Bachelor of Fine Arts in Music degrees are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><i>Music Performance</i> – Students who want to perfect their craft with intensive study and demanding performance instruction will work for a BFA in Music Performance.</li>
			<li><i>Music Composition </i>– Even more than the BA, a BFA in music composition will allow you to compose more music, and dive deeper into the art.</li>
			<li><i>Music Theory</i> – A BFA in Music Theory</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
		<p>Students who have a passion for recording, producing, or synthesizers and sound design might get a Bachelor of Science in Music. Science degrees with a musical concentration are often connected to a specific application, such as music production or a technology-based career.</p>
		<p>You can also obtain a Bachelor of Science in music business degree, for students who want to work in music production, artist development, or media distribution. Be it noted, based on the state in which the degree is offered, both the Bachelor of Arts or the Bachelor of Science are the degrees most often sought after if a student is majoring in any type of music education track.</p>
		<p>The most common Bachelor of Science in Music degrees are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><i>Sound Recording Technology (SRT) </i>– This is for students who see themselves working in studios recording artists, orchestras, and any other number of musical outfits.</li>
			<li><i>Sound Design</i> – These students explore digital technology, developing new formats to store and record music for a variety of uses.</li>
		</ul>
