		<h2><B>Overview</B></h2>
		<P>Though many may think that studying internationally is only for the wealthy,
		studying in a foreign country may actually be more affordable for the
		average family than studying in the United States.&nbsp; One of the
		most diverse countries in the world, studying in South Africa will
		expose you to many different cultures, and many South African
		universities offer quality fine arts programs for a fraction of the
		price of American schools.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s examine the costs and
		benefits of studying in South Africa and how to make it a reality.</P>

		<h2><B>Visa Requirements</B></h2>
		<P>South Africa falls in the middle concerning the strictness of student visa
		requirements.&nbsp; Like most countries, you must have health
		insurance that is valid in South Africa before your visa application
		can be accepted.&nbsp; Additionally, you must be accepted (or
		provisionally accepted) by a South African institution, and, if under
		21, you and your parents/guardians must nominate a local guardian in
		South Africa to sponsor your studies.&nbsp; You also must show that
		you are able to financially support yourself while you study in South
		Africa by having access to 3000R ($215) per month.&nbsp; This
		includes bank statements, cash on hand, traveller&rsquo;s cheques,
		credit cards, scholarships, etc. You also must pay a $125 visa
		application fee.&nbsp; The processing time for a South African study
		visa is between 4 and 8 weeks.&nbsp; You can visit
		<a target="_new" href="https://www.visaimmigrationsa.co.za/services/study-visa/" target="_new">visaimmigration.co.za</A>
		for more information on the process of attaining a study visa to South Africa.</P>

		<h2><B>Compared to the United States</B></h2>
		<P>In order to see the benefits of studying in South Africa, let&rsquo;s
		compare three South African universities to three American
		universities.&nbsp; We will compare two small institutions, two
		medium institutions, and two large institutions on factors such as
		tuition, total cost, curriculum, and extracurricular and performance
		opportunities.</P>

		<H2><B>Rhodes University vs College of the Holy Cross</B></H2>
		<P>First, let&rsquo;s compare two small institutions: Rhodes University in
		Makhanda, South Africa and College of the Holy Cross in Worcester,
		MA, USA.&nbsp; In terms of population, Rhodes has 5,600
		undergraduates, and Holy Cross has over 3,000.&nbsp; The tuition
		costs of the two are stark contrasts.&nbsp; Holy Cross charges
		$54,740 in tuition alone, and total cost can reach up to $72,000 per
		year!&nbsp; However, Rhodes charges only $5,000 in tuition for
		international students, and the total cost (including housing,
		travel, personal expenses, food, fees, etc) reaches around $14,000
		per year.</P>

		<P>Both institutions have small but excellent music programs, and both offer
		general music degrees with specializations available.&nbsp; Holy
		Cross offers a 4 year BA in Music with a specialization in an
		instrument or voice available.&nbsp; Rhodes, on the other hand,
		offers two pathways for a music degree.&nbsp; The first is the BA in
		Music, a 3 year program that teaches general music theory, history,
		and performance, and this degree can be combined with another BA
		program.&nbsp; The second route at Rhodes is the BMus (Bachelor in
		Music), which is a 4 year program, and during a student&rsquo;s
		fourth year, he or she selects five papers for the year that outline
		his or her specific interests in music, from a composition portfolio
		to a paper on music history.</P>

		<P>Both Rhodes and Holy Cross offer similar opportunities in terms of
		performance.&nbsp; Both offer audition and non-audition choirs, jazz
		band, orchestra, and string ensemble.&nbsp; Rhodes also offers wind
		band, and Holy Cross, being a Catholic college, offers chapel choir.&nbsp;
		Overall, Rhodes University offers similar programs and opportunities
		to Holy Cross at a much more affordable price.</P>

		<H2><B>Stellenbosch University vs University of Southern California</B></H2>
		<P>At 19,000 and 20,500 students, respectively, Stellenbosch University,
		located on the Western Cape, and University of Southern California,
		located in Los Angeles, CA, have similar undergraduate student body
		sizes and both fall in the middle, size-wise.&nbsp; Despite their
		similar size, they differ greatly in affordability;&nbsp;
		Stellenbosch charges around $4,100 in tuition with a total yearly
		cost of about $13,700, while USC charges around $60,500 in tuition
		with a total yearly cost of about $81,700.</P>

		<P>Both are prestigious universities, and both offer extensive curricula in
		their schools of music.&nbsp; Stellenbosch, like Rhodes, offers two
		degree routes: the BA in Music and the BMus.&nbsp; The BA in Music is
		a 3 year program that focuses on practical music study, musicology,
		music theory, and teaching methods, and students add an elective
		subject from the humanities, including studies in psychology,
		mathematics, Xhosa, English, and Afrikaans.&nbsp; The BMus is a 4
		year program; students receive foundational music training their
		first two years, and they choose a concentration their third year.
		Students can choose composition, music technology, musicology, music
		education, conducting, or performance and are able to specialize in
		an instrument of their choice in addition to their concentration.</P>

		<P>University of Southern California also offers a plethora of music programs;
		however, while USC and Stellenbosch offer similar programs, USC&rsquo;s
		programs are more specialized because instead of students receiving
		the same musical training their first two years, students are trained
		in a specific field all four years.&nbsp; Students may earn a BM in
		choral music, composition, jazz studies, music production, or
		performance; a BS in music industry; or a BFA in musical theatre.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

		<P>Additionally, both have similar ensemble opportunities.&nbsp; Both have choirs,
		orchestra, jazz ensembles, and bands, though USC offers slightly more
		ensemble opportunities.&nbsp; Overall, both of these prestigious
		universities offer in-depth music programs, yet Stellenbosch is far
		more affordable than USC.</P>

		<H2><B>North-West University vs Arizona State University</B></H2>
		<P>Both North-West University, located in Potchefstroom, South Africa, and
		Arizona State University, located in Phoenix, AZ, are large public
		universities with an undergraduate population of 50,000 and 44,000,
		respectively, and both offer BA and BM/BMus degree paths.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

		<P>NWU&rsquo;s BA in Music and Society is a 3 year program that offers basic musical
		training and focuses on music education and community music.&nbsp; On
		the other hand, NWU&rsquo;s BMus is a 4 year program, and during the
		third year, a student chooses a specialization in performance,
		methodology, musicology, music education, music theory, or
		composition.&nbsp; Arizona State also offers both BA and BM programs,
		and these programs are similar to NWU.&nbsp; Arizona State offers a
		BA in Music, a BA in Music and Culture, and a BA in Popular Music,
		and it offers a BM in Music Education, a BM in Music Therapy, a BM in
		Performance (with a specialization in instrument), and a BM in Theory
		and Composition.&nbsp; They both give students many performance
		opportunities by offering a plethora of ensembles to students.</P>

		<P>These two large universities are very similar in terms of size, curriculum,
		and performance opportunities, but they differ greatly in cost.&nbsp;
		In-state tuition for Arizona State University is $10,710, and
		out-of-state tuition is $28,800, bringing the estimated total cost to
		$29,090 and $47,180, respectively.&nbsp; North-West University
		charges international students $1,500 in tuition, and the estimated
		total yearly cost is around $7,200.&nbsp;</P>

		<h2><B>Conclusion</B></h2>
		<P>As the tables show, a music student can get a similar education to that
		of the United States in South Africa for considerably less money.&nbsp;
		In addition, studying in South Africa will expose you to many
		different cultures and give you experiences you won&rsquo;t find in
		the United States.&nbsp; Plus, the cost of living is very low in
		South Africa compared to the United States and other English-speaking
		countries.&nbsp; For these reasons, South Africa is a viable option
		for American students who seek to earn a quality education for a low
		price.</P>
