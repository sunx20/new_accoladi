		<p>It’s not what you know, it’s who you know.  The ability to turn your collegiate dream into reality will come about mainly through a positive connection to the desired college, university, or conservatory.  But how are these connections made?  First and foremost, they are made through a trusted person who values you, knows about your skills and talents, and believes that you will do them proud if they recommend you.  For college-bound high school musicians the following are the traditional ways music students makes collegiate connections:</p>
		<p>The student is recommended by their high school music teacher to the college:</p>
			
		<p style="margin-left: 20px;">1. the music teacher attended 
			<br>2. where the music teacher has friends on faculty 
			<br>3. the music teacher wants to impress</p>
			
		<p>The student is recommended by one collegiate music faculty member to another music faculty member of the same institution of higher learning. This peer-to-peer recommendation happens when:</p>
			
		<p style="margin-left: 20px;">1. the student has been a private lesson student of the faculty member
			<br>2. the student has been a summer music camper under the baton of a faculty member, whether the camp was on that specific college campus or a destination campus
			<br>3. the student has been in an honors ensemble under the baton of a faculty member, or the faculty member has met the student through judging them in a solo or small ensemble festival or competition</p>
			
		<p>The student is recommended by one collegiate music faculty member to another collegiate music faculty member of a different or sister institution of higher learning. This peer-to-peer recommendation happens when:</p>
			
		<p style="margin-left: 20px;">1. the student has taken private lessons from a faculty member who recommends the student to their alma mater
			<br>2. the student has taken private lessons from a faculty member who recommends the student to a fellow faculty member in a professional music education association in which they are both members
			<br>3. the student has taken private lessons from a faculty member at a summer music experience who recommends the student to another faculty member also on staff at the same summer music experience</p>
			
		<p>Yes, there are connections made through college fairs, high school counselor recommendations, minister recommendations to religious collegiate institutions, and the student’s application to the institution they desire to attend.  But these connection points fall short of success in comparison to the above stated relational connections.</p>
