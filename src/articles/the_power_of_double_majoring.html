		<h3>Introduction - What is (and isn&rsquo;t) a Double Major?</h3>

		<P>A double major is when a student graduates with one degree with two
		specializations.  For instance, a student can graduate with a
		Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Music and History, a Bachelor of Science
		(BS) in Music Industry Studies and Psychology, or a Bachelor of Music
		(BM) in Vocal Performance and Composition.  Requirements differ for
		double majors from university to university, and some are more
		restrictive than others when it comes to crossing disciplines in a
		double major.</P>

		<P>For instance, at most colleges and universities, a double major can only
		be earned within a degree type, so if pursuing a BA degree, a student
		may only double major in another BA field.  This especially
		complicates music majors seeking to double major in a non-musical
		field, since many music degrees are BM rather than BA.  For many BM
		students who wish to pursue an additional field of study, their only
		option is a dual degree program, and these programs are usually more
		selective and require more credit hours to complete (150 credit hours
		instead of 120 credit hours is conventional).</P>

		<P>Double majoring is not earning two separate degrees.  Additionally, a double
		major is not earning both a bachelor&rsquo;s and a master&rsquo;s
		degree at the same time.  Both of these instances are examples of
		dual degree programs, not double majoring.</P>

		<h3>Costs of Double Majoring</h3>

		<P><U>Does Double Majoring cost more money?</U></P>
		<P>Not usually.  If you complete both majors within the credit, course,
		and/or time limits, the cost of tuition will usually cover both
		programs.  Depending on the institution, if you are not able to
		complete your double major in four years, your scholarships and
		financial aid can apply to a fifth year. </P>

		<P><U>Does Double Majoring take more than four years?</U></P>
		<P>Usually, a student can complete a double major within four years.  Some
		colleges, like the College of the Holy Cross, are committed to a
		four-year schedule while some colleges are more </P>

		<P>flexible when it comes to a graduation time frame.  Depending on the college
		or university, graduating with a double major in four years may not
		be feasible.</P>

		<P><U>Does Double Majoring allow less room to take electives outside of the
		majors&rsquo; programs?</U></P>
		<P>Yes. If a student double majors, he or she will have less room to take
		classes outside of his or her majors.  Most colleges require 120
		credit hours to earn a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree, so if a student
		decides to double major, there will be less credit hours/courses
		available for electives.  This means that a double major must plan
		ahead, clearly understand the requirements of both majors as well as
		the general education requirements of the school, and be efficient
		with which classes he or she takes.  Having a four-year course plan
		is essential to completing all requirements of both majors in four
		years, and &ldquo;double dipping&rdquo; (one class fulfilling
		multiple requirements) helps increase flexibility when selecting
		classes.</P>

		<h3>Benefits of Double Majoring</h3>
		<P><U>Does Double Majoring help in job and/or graduate school applications?</U></P>
		<P>It can.  According to the American Community Survey Census, 12.5% of
		young Americans have a double major, and this percentage has been
		shrinking despite the percentage of people with college degrees
		growing.  This can set double majors apart as individuals with
		planning and time management skills as well as having a wider breadth
		of knowledge. </P>

		<P><U>Does Double Majoring pay more in the job market?</U></P>
		<P>This depends.  Dr. Joni Hersch of Vanderbilt University and Dr. Alison Del
		Rossi of St. Lawrence University composed a research paper called
		&ldquo;The Private and Social Benefits of Double Majors.&rdquo;  They
		divide majors into three categories (STEM, business, and liberal
		arts) and compare the effects of all combinations of these three
		categories into four effect groups (Earnings, Research &amp;
		Development, Degree-Job Match, and Job Satisfaction).  </P>

		<P>They found that compared to those with one major in liberal arts (under
		which music is included), those who double major in liberal arts and
		business fields or in liberal arts and STEM earn more than 10% more
		than those with a single liberal arts area degree.  They also found
		that those with two liberal arts degrees earn roughly the same as
		those with one liberal arts degree.  </P>

		<P>So, whether or not double majoring increases your income depends on what
		your majors are, and double majoring in a business or STEM field in
		addition to your music degree statistically increases your chance of
		earning more than if you major only in a musical field.</P>

		<P><U>What benefit is there in double majoring in music + another field?</U></P>
		<P>Double majoring in music and a non-music field can benefit you in a few
		ways.  First, it can expand your area of knowledge and give you more
		opportunities across different industries, thus leading to more job
		opportunities.  Second, it can help you become more specialized and
		point you toward a specific field.  Thirdly, as stated above, if you
		major in music and a STEM or business field, you are likely to earn
		higher wages than if you just major in a music field.</P>

		<P><U>Should I double major in another music field or in a non-music field?</U></P>
		<P>This depends on what career objectives you have in mind.  If you seek to
		use music to enter industries such as business or healthcare, a
		double major across disciplines with a BA in Music may be beneficial
		for you.  Conversely, if you seek to enter into composition or into
		performance of a particular instrument, a specialized BM or a double
		major of two BM fields may be more beneficial for you than a double
		major in General Music and another discipline.  </P>

		<h3>Examples of College Double Major Requirements</h3>

		<P><U>The University of North Texas</U></P>
		<P>At the University of North Texas, double majors must be within the same
		type of degree (within the BA, within the BS, within the BM, etc).
		So, as a music major, you can double major in two BM programs (like
		Vocal Performance and Choral Studies), you can major in General Music
		(BA) and another BA program (like political science), or you can
		pursue a dual degree program across degree types.</P>

		<P><U>The University of Texas at Austin</U></P>
		<P>Like The University of North Texas, UTA allows students to double major in
		fields of the same degree type.  Students may major in programs
		across degree types and earn a dual degree. So, a student may
		graduate with a BM in a field such as Composition and a BA in a field
		such as History under the dual degree program, but not the double
		major program.</P>

		<P><U>Florida State University</U></P>
		<P>A student can double major with a music program and non-music program
		if he or she majors in Liberal Arts Music Studies (BA/MA).  However,
		if a student majors in a BM field and wishes to double major, he or
		she must double major in another BM field.</P>

		<P><U>University of the Pacific</U></P>
		<P>Similar to other colleges, students attaining a BA in Music at University of
		the Pacific may double major in any field outside of the University&rsquo;s
		Conservatory of Music while students attaining a BM may only double
		major in other fields within the Conservatory of Music.  </P>

		<P><U>University of Missouri at Kansas City</U></P>
		<P>Students can only double major in BA or BS fields, so they can only double
		major in the BA in Music with another BA program.  So, students in BM
		fields may not double major at all, even with other BM fields.</P>

		<P><U>Rice University</U></P>
		<P>Rice University&rsquo;s double major program is an anomaly.  Unlike most
		colleges, a double major at Rice may cross degree types, such as a BS
		in Physics and a BA in religion.  The student then chooses a primary
		major, and the student&rsquo;s degree will be that of the primary
		major.  So, if the student&rsquo;s primary major is Physics, he or
		she will graduate with a BS in Physics with the notation &ldquo;Student
		has additionally met the requirements for a major in Religion,
		normally associated with a Bachelor of Arts degree.&rdquo;  This is
		called the &ldquo;no major&rdquo; path and is a Rice tradition.  The
		benefit of this route is that music students may obtain a BM degree
		with a BA program attached without having to complete the extra
		course hours required under the dual degree program.</P>

		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<P>Double majoring is a great commitment that can be time consuming and
		difficult, but it can have many benefits.  If considering double
		majoring, especially in music and another field, you should research
		universities&rsquo; policies concerning double majoring across
		disciplines, schools, and degree types in order to find the
		university that best suits your educational and career objectives.</P>
