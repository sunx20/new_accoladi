		<p>You’ve spent most of your time and money preparing yourself musically for your audition. You
		know you can have a stellar performance on your solo, excerpts, and scales. And like everyone
		who ever auditioned, you are slightly worried about your sightreading. You’ve studied basic
		music theory and music history and you’re confident you will do well on the school of music
		entrance exam. You know exactly what your career path in music will be, and the school you’re
		auditioning at is world renowned for producing professionals in your chosen field. There is no
		question…you will be admitted and you’ll get an accompanying scholarship.
		But . . .Are you sure?</p>

		<p>Have you read the bios of each ensemble director? Have you read the bios of the private studio
		instructors you could be spending the next four years with ? Have you compared their bios?
		Maybe they went to college together? Did any of these directors, professors, and instructors
		receive their undergraduate degrees from the institution where you’re auditioning? Maybe one
		of these individuals taught your high school music teacher? Is your high school music teacher in
		the same professional music organizations as any of the professors? Maybe the same state
		music educators association, the American Choral Directors Association, the American School
		Band Directors Association or the American String Teachers Association? The list of possible
		associations can go on and on. Oh, and do you know where these professors come from? Are
		any from your state or even your hometown?</p>

		<p>In what ways can you relate to them as individuals? And…will they like you?
		There is a distinction between your high school directors and your college mentors. In high
		school, they must teach you because a scholastic school administrator has decided who is going
		to teach you and that teacher has no choice who they teach.</p>

		<p>However, college is different - the college admissions department decides if you’re a good fit
		for their institution – this is the general admission decision. Then you must audition for the
		music department and they decide if you are a good fit for them. So, in college, the music
		department, not the administration decides. Do you see the difference?</p>

		<p>The high school administrator tells the teacher who they are going to teach while the college
		music professors and directors tells the administration who they are going to teach.
		So, the collegiate ensemble directors and studio instructors understand you are an excellent
		performing musician with great potential. But do they like you enough to allow into their
		academic lives for the next four years? Upon graduation you will be their alumnus, and do they
		believe you will be a strong, vibrant representative for their institution? After school, you may
		be a colleague, members of the same associations and organizations. More immediately, they
		are trying to visualize you in their ensemble. They are imagining what you might be like on tour
		next spring in South Korea and Indonesia. They are thinking how well you are going to fit in with
		the other ensemble members or students in the studio. “Liking” someone is an important
		aspect of the audition process. And “like” goes two ways – will you like them and will they like
		you?</p>

		<p>So, ask yourself this question: Am I likeable? Will these decision makers think that I’m
		relatable? Will they see me as an someone who will be an asset to their department? Will I fit
		in? Am I fun to be around? A good conversationalist?</p>

		<p>Now you may think you are not likeable. You may have even been told you’re not likeable. Only
		a mother could like you! But you have gotten this far in life, and I guarantee you…something
		about you is likeable. Maybe you have a great ear, or relative pitch or a funny sense of irony.
		Ask your favorite aunt or grandparent, or a good friend. Sometimes other people can point out
		your likeability factory far better than you can.</p>

		<p>So, as you prepare musically for your audition don’t forget to also prepare to be likeable.</p>
