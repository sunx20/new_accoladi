		<h2 class="article-sub-title" >An Important Message for Performers:</h2>
		<h2>Here is the spiel my performer friends.</h2>
		<p>Students who want to go to college face three primary decisions:</p>
		<p>What should be my major?<br>
			What are my college choices?<br>
			How do I find solutions for paying for college?</p>
		<p>Here is my message for students in the performing arts.</p>
		
		<h3>1. Decide your interests.</h3>
		<p>Do you want to continue performing in college? Even if you don’t want to major in music, performing after high school can reduce or even eliminate the cost of college.</p>
		
		<h3>2. Pick the right fit.</h3>
		<p>Learn what collegiate programs excel in your discipline and have ensembles for your musical emphasis, such as pep band or choir. Scholarships are given to students that fill an ensemble void.</p>
		
		<h3>3. Sign up FREE at accoladi.com.</h3>
		<p>Build your profile for recruiters to view. When you are ready to be visible to them (around your sophomore or junior year), it’s only $7.95/month!</p>
		<p>Are you in an underserved community or maybe attending a Title 1 school?</p>
