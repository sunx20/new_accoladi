		<h3>Master of Arts (MA)</h3>
		<p>The Master of Arts in Music is a degree that requires first obtaining a bachelor’s degree. As an additional educational credential, these programs are for students who want to obtain an advanced degree in any number of musical applications. Concentrations in the Master of Arts degree are largely the same as the Bachelor of Music, but with more intense study. </p>

		<h3>Master of Science (MS)</h3>
		<p>The Master of Science is a secondary degree you receive after your first college degree. Students who want to further their skills in audio engineering, sound recording technology, and several other fields might find this the best option.</p>

		<h3>Master of Music (MM)</h3>
		<p>The Master of Music degree is a course of study more closely focused with musical pursuits. In some cases, these degrees require less courses outside of music, and in some cases—though not all—you receive more musical training than a Master of Arts.</p>

		<h3>Doctorate Degree (PhD)</h3>
		<p>A Doctorate of Music degree, sometimes just called a Doctor of Music, a Doctoral Degree, or PhD (which stands for the Latin term philosophiae doctor or Doctor of Philosophy) is awarded to students who have made a significant contribution to the world of music in terms of composition, recordings, and research.</p>
		<p>A focus of all PhD degrees is adding knowledge to the field, furthering a general understanding of music overall. This is done through publishing dissertations or theses which explore at a scientific or philosophical level a subject regarding music.</p>

		<h3>Doctorate of Musical Arts (DMA)</h3>
		<p>While a PhD is a more academic degree, the Doctorate of Musical Arts is focused more on performance, composition, or theory than any other degree. Master musicians will embark on these degree tracks to become authorities in their instrument and creative pursuits.</p>

		<h3>Artist Degree (AD)</h3>
		<p>The Artist Degree, also known as the Artist Diploma, is a highly focused credential which is usually obtained after a Bachelor’s Degree. There are typically no courses outside of music with these degrees. In most cases, professional musicians will take on this degree track to further sharpen their skills. The students of these degrees are generally already authorities in their field.</p>

		<h4>Which degree is right for you?</h4>
		<p>The right music degree for you is whichever helps you achieve your goals. Just like knowing which is the right music school, the perfect degree should help you embrace your particular interests above all else.</p>
