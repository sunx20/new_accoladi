		<p>Colleges, universities, and conservatories want to get to know you.
			They want to know if you are what they are looking for to meet their ensemble needs, and they are embracing the concept of a pre-screen audition video.
			Yes, the pre-screen has become incredibly popular, with both new and traditional college programs alike adding themselves to the pre-screen list every year.
			So as you prepare to film your session, here are eight tips to get the most out of your pre-screen college audition video.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Plan out the shoot.
				One of the worst feelings is to finish filming and to realize you forgot an introduction video requirement or didn’t film a composition or song in the specific way a school requested.
				If you forget something, it’s very important that you re-shoot.
				Colleges receive thousands of pre-screen videos, and you don’t want to not pass a pre-screen because you did not follow directions.
				Think of it as your first college test: being thoughtful about making sure you have everything you need to film, as well as planning out the structure of your shoot, will allow you to have a smooth filming experience.
			</li>
			<li>
				Make-Up Tips / Apply and Reapply.
				It is important that you look fresh throughout your shoot.
				This is your first visual impression, so you want to budget time into the shoot to make sure your hair and makeup stays consistent.
				This is especially true for musical theater students, but it is also true for every other performer.
				You do not want to look washed out on the camera so a simple foundation and a very little amount of blush can help with this concern.
				If you are a singer very light lip gloss is suggested.
				Don’t over-do.
			</li>
			<li>
				Pay attention to background, lighting, and sound balance.
				Background, lighting, and sound balance are the most important technical elements you want to keep in mind when you film.
				The background should be clean and simple; if you use a sheet, make sure it’s not too wrinkled.
				The lighting should be bright enough to see you and your facial expressions especially if you are a singer.
				The sound should be balanced; make sure the piano doesn’t drown out your solo performance.
			</li>
			<li>
				No more than three takes per requirement!
				There’s a common misconception that you can just keep recording until you get it perfect.
				If you were already &quot;perfect,&quot; then what would you spend four years in a BFA program working on? The college audition faculty is looking for potential, not perfection.
				If you over-think and make too many takes, you’ll get into your head and begin to doubt yourself.
				Make three recordings per requirement and submit the best one.
			</li>
			<li>
				There is a difference between direct-to-camera and off-camera focus.
				The general rule that you want to follow is that slates and any video introductions should be filmed looking directly into the camera lens; for musical theater students and singers the monologue and song material should be filmed with you looking slightly to the left or right of the camera.
				You would never deliver a monologue or song in a college audition using the audition panel as your scene partner, and the same rule applies to pre-screen filming.
				This is also true for instrumentalist, be natural and don’t overplay your direct look into the camera.
			</li>
			<li>
				Establish your physical parameters before filming.
				You want to always stay in frame, so if you’re moving at all in your audition material make sure you know what your physical boundaries are to stay in frame.
				This is definitely an interesting challenge when putting material on-camera that’s intended for a physical, in-person audition—you’ll have to adjust slightly for the film medium.
				If you move out of frame or get too close to the camera, your brilliant take might not be usable.
			</li>
			<li>
				Be mindful of the framing specifics of each college.
				For singers and musical theater students, note that some pre-screen schools want a mixture of &quot;full-body&quot; and &quot;waist up&quot; shots.
				&quot; Other schools want one &quot;shoulders up&quot; and one &quot;full-body.
				&quot; Depending on your combination of pre-screen schools, this might require you to budget more time in your filming to re-adjust your framing.
				If you are an instrumentalist (other than bassoonist or cellist) you will want to stand for the entire audition and film a simple full body shot.
				Do not let the music stand be the focal point of the filming.
				You may decide to have the stand off camera or use your TV to show your musical score and play from this larger screen.
				This is also a great concept for singers who have not yet memorized all their music.
				And for all auditionees, whether musical theater, singers, or instrumentalists smile and look proud of your performance when the section is over and make sure the camera does not cut off without getting your smiling face.

			The pre-screen is the dress rehearsal before the college audition.
			Although filming a pre-screen video might seem intimidating, this part of the college audition process can really help you to focus your attention on the programs that are most interested in seeing your live audition.
			Again, this is very important, look happy and engaging.
			Remember that you love what you’re doing and have chosen to dedicate your college education to training in the performing arts.
			Don’t let the fear of the college audition process and your first big on-camera experience paralyze you.
			Musicians are creative, so stay passionate throughout your pre-screen filming and share your heart in every take.
			Recruiters will seek to experience that special passion in your presentation.
			So, it is your duty to deliver the goods!
