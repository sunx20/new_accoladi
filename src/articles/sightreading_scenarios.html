		<P>
			You may be wondering what
			kind of music you&rsquo;ll be asked to play for the sightreading
			portion of your audition. It&rsquo;s really hard to guess because
			composing software lets anyone create a unique composition in a
			matter of minutes! You may be confronted with a brand-new composition
			a graduate student created just before your audition slot. Never
			fear; I have some tips that will help you excel. Here are examples
			from two schools that you might encounter anywhere you audition.
		</P>

		<h3>Example 1</h3>
		<P>
			A university in the
			Midwest uses an innovative method. They review your repertoire list,
			etude studies, scales and arpeggios. After the review, a graduate
			student uses your data to create two contrasting pieces derived from
			your list. For example, a clarinet auditioner may list:
		</P>

		<UL>
			<LI>An 8th grade performance of &quot;Chanson Moderne&quot; by Hovey and Leonard</LI>
			<LI>A 10th grade performance of &quot;Concerto in G Minor&quot; by Handel arranged by Waln</LI>
			<LI>An 11th grade performance of &quot;Dance Preludes&quot; by Lutoslawski</LI>
		</UL>

		<P>
			Based on that list, the
			graduate student will arrange a 64-measure composition which will
			include excerpts from these selections tied together by variations of
			traditional scale patterns. You can expect the scales to be presented
			in a non-traditional way which will lead to:
		</P>

		<UL>
			<LI>mixed meter patterns</LI>
			<LI>contrasting time signatures</LI>
			<LI>simple meter and compound meter</LI>
		</UL>

		<P>
			Why do they do this? It
			helps the panel determine if you&rsquo;re a solid sightreader or if
			you have memorized the solos. They are also looking to see if you can
			turn scale exercises into true musical expression.
		</P>

		<h3>Example 2</h3>
		<P>
			A university on the west
			coast creates three sightreading compositions that, at first glance,
			all look the same. You may see no difference in the notes, meter, or
			key. But:
		</P>

		<UL>
			<LI>the title of each composition is different</LI>
			<LI>the dynamic markings are different</LI>
			<LI>the musical terms are different</LI>
		</UL>

		<P>
			For instance, the first
			composition may be entitled &quot;Danz&oacute;n for a Texas
			Mix-Master,&quot; the second composition, &quot;Lullaby for Charles
			Augustus Lindbergh, Jr.,&quot; and the third, &quot;Scherzo con
			Brio.&quot; A glance at the metronome marking, contrast in musical
			terms, and title of the composition all present the style in which
			you should play each selection.
		</P>

		<P>
			Why do they do this? The
			audition adjudication panel looks for a keen music history knowledge,
			performance technique, and musical interpretation. 
		</P>

		<h3>What can you do to prepare?</h3>
		<P>
			Remember the goal is to
			give a complete musical performance with your sightreading. Keep
			reviewing your past performance repertoire and reading past the
			notes, meter, and key. Bringing all of your musical and performance
			techniques together will result in an outstanding sightreading
			performance.
		</P>
