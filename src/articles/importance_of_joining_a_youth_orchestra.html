		<p>Joining Community Youth Orchestras is very important to students who want to stand out to collegiate recruiters. But which students should join? A student should consider joining a community youth orchestra (CYO) if the following characteristics describe them:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>natural potential to become a great musician</li>
			<li>natural potential to become a great musician
				private, additional lessons are being taken under a skilled teacher
			</li>
			<li>self-motivated to practice and make improvements
			</li>
			<li>are already one of the top performers among peers
			</li>
			<li>have a good instrument – better than a first, "starter-kit"
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Students with most of these characteristics are highly sought after by collegiate recruiters because they allow students to stand out against their competition and the "<i>average performer</i>."
		</p>
		<p>But how can a student measure up to the best talent in an entire district, even the state? Joining a CYO can be one avenue to help propel a student to a higher level of artistry in a relatively short time.
		</p>
		<p>Students in a CYO find themselves being challenged by very talented performers on a regular basis. One orchestra group I follow has 250 total students participating in 3 orchestras. They come from 80 different schools from 45 different cities and towns located in 2 separate states. Not only are they talented, but they arrive with a high level of commitment to the ensembles.
		</p>
		<p>If students are not playing regularly, and not competing against other talent, students are failing to challenge their potential. Lack of inspiration can cost a student thousands of dollars in <i>future scholarship money</i> – and possibly undermine career opportunities where the financial impact is even more significant. Even peer pressure can be a positive force!</p>
		<p>In a top CYO, students receive rich and high-quality experiences through rehearsals and performances. Even if students are performing level 6 and 7 material, CYO’s can provide the opportunity to expand a student’s abilities and repertoire. Advanced CYOs usually play original masterworks at the collegiate and even professional level. Adding orchestral works to a <i>cholarshipAuditions.com </i>Sprofile, provides a competitive edge for students and attracts faculties from the best programs in the country! So, don’t forget, joining community youth orchestras can open doors of opportunity.
