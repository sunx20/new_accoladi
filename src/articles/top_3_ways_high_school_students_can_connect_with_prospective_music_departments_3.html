		<p>Do your research and find a summer camp, summer stock, extended master class or summer enrichment event on the college campus that you are hoping to attend. This extended exposure to the college ensemble director or show director provides opportunities to get to know one another, and to discover their style of instructing. These camps on college campuses are usually for one week, occasionally two. More than a week allows for you to take at least one or two private lessons from the studio instructor you are interested in.
		</p>
		<p>Some states hold All-State training camps, especially All-State <b>chorus</b> training camps. Most often these camps are led by high school teachers, which does not guarantee exposure to the college ensemble director or the college studio instructor. However, research reveals that these camps really do give the All-State auditioning student an advantage in the audition process. And making All-State is paramount in catching the attention of a music department college recruiter. So, this is a good thing.
		</p>
		<p>Some multi-week camps are conducted from four up to nine weeks. Governor’s School of the Arts summer sessions in your state and others are nationally noted camps, academies or summer conservatories and require an expanded application and audition for consideration. These camps offer exceptional benefits especially when it comes to collegiate and scholarship opportunities. College, university and conservatory recruiters scout for students from these camps. Almost all offer a college day or fair, even a college weekend in order for recruiters and high caliber students to interact.
		</p>
		<p>Attendance at these summer camps, especially extended week camps, is highly recommended. They have significant influence on recruiters and play an historical role in the selection and scholarship process for students at America’s most noted collegiate institutions.</p>
		<p><b>Starting the process demonstrates your courage and conviction. Initiate positive relationships and they will be rewarded. Reach out for your dream. Turn your dream into your reality. </b></p>
