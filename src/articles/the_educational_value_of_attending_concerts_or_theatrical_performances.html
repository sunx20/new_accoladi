		<h2 class="article-sub-title" >Performances For Future Music Professionals</h2>
		<p>There are a lot of valuable takeaways students can gain by attending concerts or theatrical performances. Students learn musical, cultural and professional values when they attend concerts outside their normal course of study. While all students can benefit from attending these performances, it is especially important to students who are considering a degree in music.</p>
		
		<h3>Musical</h3>
		<p>College programs like to see students who have demonstrated commitment to their discipline by immersing themselves in additional opportunities. One way to do that is to expose yourself to areas of the performing arts that you might not have experienced before. As a result, you might even come to like a particular genre or medium you didn’t really understand before.</p>
		<p>What is the best, largest venue show you have ever attended? Was it local? Consider attending a regional concert, headlining a well-known performer. It could prove to be an eye-opening experience witnessing someone perform on a big stage in front of thousands of people. You might come to find out the atmosphere is just for you. You might also find that a smaller, more intimate venue is more suited to you. You’ll never know until you experience it.</p>
		<p>Regardless of your musical concentration or activities in school now, you will study all areas of music in college. Expanding your knowledge and experiences with new music in performances will only improve your repertoire moving forward. Remember, you can’t say you don’t like something if you haven’t tried it!</p>
		
		<h3>Cultural</h3>
		<p>Premier vocalists, like Andrea Bocelli, use multiple languages and different genres of music at concerts to share stories with people from different cultures. Meanwhile, a play can transport you anywhere, into any time period: visit the French Revolution in "Les Misérables", the American Civil War in "Gone with the Wind", the 1960s civil rights movement in Hairspray. Performances like these can provide you exposure to other cultures in addition to musical excellence.</p>
		<p>You are more than likely accustomed to dressing casually when you go to the movie theater, or while attending a sporting event. But most concerts and theatrical performances require audiences to dress formally. Dressing up shows respect to the performer(s) and an appreciation for the sophistication and tradition of the art form. It’s a different type of atmosphere for younger audiences to learn.</p>
		
		<h3>Professionalism</h3>
		<p>There is quite a difference in the level of talent and amount of experience between high school and college performers. In the professional world, community theater, traveling Broadway plays, and theater in New York City demonstrate different levels of ability and dedication. Try to expose yourself to a wide range of showmanship, so you have a starting point of what to work towards in a career in the performing arts.</p>
		<p>You can always read a book or listen to music at home, but attending a live performance is a special experience. To share the atmosphere, and in many cases, participate in the quality of the show (because performers can see you and respond to the audience’s energy) is an entirely new and wonderful way to expose yourself to the world of performing arts.</p>
