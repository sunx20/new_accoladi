		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>So you took the leap of faith into the arms of another country's education system, but you have no idea what life is going to be like. This feeling is completely normal but can be curbed with research and preparation. A country's culture can change drastically from region to region, meaning that there can be certain actions or lifestyles that are acceptable in one place but may be considered offensive in the next. Furthermore, each country has their own unique laws, attitudes, and customs, meaning that some actions that are common practice in the US may be illegal in another country and could get you arrested. A perfect example of this is chewing gum in Singapore. If you somehow were able to smuggle chewing gum into Singapore, you could be facing a fine of up to 1,000 SGD ($745). </p>
		<p>The process of becoming an international student can be quite difficult and requires a lot of patience and discipline. This article will explain how to obtain a student visa, adapt to differences in culture and lifestyle, and find resources that can help you transition to another country. Let this article serve as your guide on how to become an international student and how to function with minimal resources and no close family.</p>
		<h3><b>"<i>Education is simply the soul of a society as it passes from one generation to another</i>." ~ Gilbert K. Chesterton</b></h3>
		<h3>Do Your Research</h3>
		<p>In deciding to attend college internationally, make sure that you do your due-diligence. A college may be affordable, but is it accredited in the United States? Does it offer the program/courses you want to take? Does it have good performance opportunities? What are the application requirements? How do I get housing? These are the questions you need to ask yourself before the application process. Luckily, Accoladi.com has this information, making this information more accessible to students.</p>
		<h3>Obtain a Student Visa</h3>
		<p>Obtaining a student or study visa is a long and complicated process, as there are many crucial steps, fees, and dates of which you must be mindful. When applying for the visa, write everything down and create a file of all the necessary paperwork. The required paperwork can be found on the country’s immigration services website. There, you can find all the requirements to apply for a study visa. Most countries require you to actually go to their embassy or consulate to deliver your paperwork and be interviewed. </p>
		<h3>Timing</h3>
		<p>The most important part of obtaining a study visa for another country is <b>timing</b>. The timeline of obtaining a student visa varies from country to country, so be mindful of the country’s deadlines and requirements and submit the required documents on time. For instance, China requires that you already have your college’s acceptance letter, which means that you can only apply for a student visa after you have been accepted into a Chinese institution. In the UK, the visa application process must start 6 months before the start of your first course, and the decision of whether the visa will be granted can take up to 3 weeks.</p>
		<h3>Fees</h3>
		<p>Planning out required financials is just as important as planning ahead for timely response times from the embassy/consulate. In some countries like Singapore, a student visa application fee is only $44, but for a student visa in the UK, it will cost you $483. Furthermore, in the UK there is a healthcare surcharge. But as far as visa expenses go, these are minute in comparison to the requirement that you prove your ability to financially support yourself during your stay. For Singapore, this amount is $3,600, and in South Korea, it is $13,000. In other countries the affordability amount is not as expensive. For South Africa, you only have to prove access to $211 per month for the year of school. You can prove this through access to cash-on-hand, credit cards, traveler’s cheques, scholarships, etc.</p>
		<h3>Culture is Relative</h3>
		<p>The first strategy is to remember that culture is relative; there are parts of every culture that are disliked just as much as they are liked. In countries like China, there are a number of differences when it comes to how people act, dress, eat, communicate, etc. Although these differences may seem strange at first, try to keep yourself as adventurous as possible. This curiosity will train you to be more comfortable in uncomfortable situations. Remain open minded, and allow yourself to be flexible. As a new member of the culture, you won't understand all of the nuances immediately, but with time, you will start to feel more akin to your new home. </p>
		<h3>Take Your Time</h3>
		<p>There are many pieces to the puzzle that make up a foreign nation's culture. Even though the puzzle may not be complete or whole in your mind, this doesn’t mean that the culture shouldn’t be respected. This respect can come in the form of blessing someone after they sneeze in Canada, refusing a compliment in China, or buying drinks for your new-found colleagues at a pub in the UK. </p>
		<h3>Give Yourself Grace</h3>
		<p>After growing up with a certain set of lifestyle practices, there is no reason to ever feel uncomfortable because everyone else around you has a different lifestyle than you. The same goes for those who are misinformed or unaware of the habits of your culture. If someone were to make a generalization or assume something about you solely based on a cultural stereotype, as frustrating as that may be, the best way to handle it is with a little grace.</p>
		<h3>Language</h3>
		<p>Additionally, knowing the local vernacular is very helpful when making personal connections; these connections are essential to your education and future as an international student and potential resident. The people with whom you connect will only help to grow your knowledge and understanding of the resident culture. This understanding will help you to avoid cultural faux pas, alleviating some of the anxiety of the unknown parts of the culture. Friends who are native to the country will be a great way to explore your unfamiliar surroundings. They know the best places to get to know the uniqueness of the new country, without the cultural buffer that tourist attraction landmarks tend to have.</p>
		<h3>Get Involved</h3>
		<p>Another good way to get connected and help curb the feelings of homesickness is to join a club. Most Universities have various clubs that can be a great starting point to meet both local and other international students. This can be in the form of a musical group, a sports team, an advocacy club, a political club, a college newspaper, and the list goes on. Clubs, student-led organizations, and performance/sports groups are a great avenue for meeting other students, getting involved with the campus community, and curbing homesickness. </p>
		<h3>International Student Resources</h3>
		<p>A good place to get connected with other international students is the university’s website. Oftentimes, the university has a list of resources for international students. In addition to the on-campus sources of support there are many off campus. Countries such as Australia have an international student hotline, which offers help on work study or housing.</p>
		<h3>Housing</h3>
		<p>When moving to another country, figuring out where you will live should be among your top priorities. Your first step should always be to check your institution's website, as many schools have on campus housing. But when studying in countries like Singapore, where on campus housing is limited, what options do you have? In Singapore’s case, housing prices are massively regulated so finding off-campus accommodations can be as simple as finding listings on websites like AnyPlace (<i>https://www.anyplace.com/student-housing/singapore/singapore</i>) or Student.com (<i>https://www.student.com/sg/singapore</i>). If a school doesn’t have on campus housing, they will usually have websites similar to these, where affordable and conveniently located housing can be found. </p>
		<h3>Financial Aid</h3>
		<p>If you study internationally as an American citizen, you may still be eligible for Federal Student Aid through FAFSA. Here is a list of foreign institutions where you will still be eligible for Federal Student Aid: <i>Foreign Institutions Participating in Federal Student Loans.xlsx</i>. Additionally, most schools offer scholarships, bursaries, and financial aid, and you can find this information on your school’s website. </p>
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>The road to becoming an international student can be difficult if not planned accordingly. There are many factors in this tedious process, meaning decisions have to be made a lot sooner than if you attend a local institution. Beginning the decision-making process in your junior year of high school is a common practice among current international students. And, after the strenuous process of applying, auditioning, and getting accepted ensues actually <b>being</b> an international student. Everyone’s first year of college is stressful, and attending college in another country can make your first year seem impossibly difficult. However, if you are passionate about gaining an affordable education as well as immersing yourself in another culture, then going through this process is absolutely worth the extra work and will be so rewarding. Good luck!</p>
