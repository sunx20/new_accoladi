		<P>When deciding on a career path in music, there are four different types of
			undergraduate degrees which can have music as its focus.</P>

		<h3>Bachelor of Music (BM)</h3>
		<P>The Bachelor of Music is the most common type of music degree. It&apos;s
			this type of degree that is almost exclusively offered at
			conservatories and music departments at universities. Students who
			pursue this degree will expect to concentrate on performance,
			composition, and theory; yet this type of degree is available in
			almost any concentration depending on the institution.</P>

		<P>Some schools offer a Bachelor of Music in Music Theory, or in Music
			Production, for instance. Still, the main difference between a
			Bachelor of Music and any other type of degree is its concentration
			on music-related material. Students who pursue a Bachelor of Music
			will take less non-musical courses here than in other degree tracks.</P>

		<h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
		<P>The Bachelor of Arts (BA) is a generalized degree which offers an
			education that is usually not performance-focused, but there are
			exceptions to this rule.</P>

		<P>Perfect for students who want a well-rounded education, the BA in Arts is
			great for the following types of concentrations:</P>

		<P><U>Bachelor of Arts In Music</U> -
			A generalized degree which can encompass performance, but also music
			history, theory, and composition.</P>

		<P><U>Bachelor of Arts in Music With A Concentration</U> -
			These degrees offer more classes in a specific focus, often based on
			the goal of further study, or a career.</P>

		<UL>
			<LI><U>Musicology</U> - The study of musical history, and its cultural and sociological implications</LI>
			<LI><U>Music Theory</U> - You learn the rules of music, with all its ins and outs</LI>
			<LI><U>Composition</U> - The art of composing music is your focus</LI>
		</UL>

		<h3>Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA)</h3>
		<P>Then, there is the Bachelor of Fine Arts. This degree is the realm where
			performance majors may study. Composition or theory majors can also
			obtain BFAs in Music for a deeper exploration into their craft,
			generally deeper than a Bachelor of Arts, but less than a Bachelor of
			Music.</P>

		<P>The most common Bachelor of Fine Arts in Music degrees are:</P>

		<UL>
			<LI><U>Music Performance</U> - Students who want to perfect their craft with intensive study and demanding performance instruction will work for a BFA in Music Performance.</LI>
			<LI><U>Music Composition</U> - Even more than the BA, a BFA in music composition will allow you to compose more music, and dive deeper into the art.</LI>
			<LI><U>Music Theory</U> - A BFA in Music Theory</LI>
		</UL>

		<h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
		<P>Students who have a passion for recording, producing, or synthesizers and
			sound design might get a Bachelor of Science in Music. Science
			degrees with a musical concentration are often connected to a
			specific application, such as music production or a technology-based
			career.</P>

		<P>You can also obtain a Bachelor of Science in music business degree, for
			students who want to work in music production, artist development, or
			media distribution. Be it noted, based on the state in which the
			degree is offered, both the Bachelor of Arts or the Bachelor of
			Science are the degrees most often sought after if a student is
			majoring in any type of music education track.</P>

		<P>The most common Bachelor of Science in Music degrees are:</P>

		<UL>
			<LI><U>Sound Recording Technology (SRT)</U> - This is for students who see themselves working in studios recording artists, orchestras, and any other number of musical outfits.</LI>
			<LI><U>Sound Design</U> - These students explore digital technology, developing new formats to store and record music for a variety of uses.</LI>
		</UL>

		<h3><B>Graduate Music Degrees</B></h3>

		<h3>Master of Arts (MA)</h3>
		<P>The Master of Arts in Music is a degree that requires first obtaining a
			bachelor&apos;s degree. As an additional educational credential,
			these programs are for students who want to obtain an advanced degree
			in any number of musical applications. Concentrations in the Master
			of Arts degree are largely the same as the Bachelor of Music, but
			with more intense study.</P>

		<h3>Master of Science (MS)</h3>
		<P>The Master of Science is a secondary degree you receive after your first
			college degree. Students who want to further their skills in audio
			engineering, sound recording technology, and several other fields
			might find this the best option.</P>

		<h3>Master of Music (MM)</h3>
		<P>The Master of Music degree is a course of study more closely focused with
			musical pursuits. In some cases, these degrees require less courses
			outside of music, and in some cases (though not all) you
			receive more musical training than a Master of Arts.</P>

		<h3>Doctorate Degree (PhD)</h3>
		<P>A Doctorate of Music degree, sometimes just called a Doctor of Music, a
			Doctoral Degree, or PhD (which stands for the Latin term philosophiae
			doctor or Doctor of Philosophy) is awarded to students who have made
			a significant contribution to the world of music in terms of
			composition, recordings, and research.</P>

		<P>A focus of all PhD degrees is adding knowledge to the field, furthering
			a general understanding of music overall. This is done through
			publishing dissertations or theses which explore at a scientific or
			philosophical level a subject regarding music.</P>

		<h3>Doctorate of Musical Arts (DMA)</h3>
		<P>While a PhD is a more academic degree, the Doctorate of Musical Arts is
			focused more on performance, composition, or theory than any other
			degree. Master musicians will embark on these degree tracks to become
			authorities in their instrument and creative pursuits.</P>

		<h3>Artist Degree (AD)</h3>
		<P>The Artist Degree, also known as the Artist Diploma, is a highly focused
			credential which is usually obtained after a Bachelor&apos;s Degree.
			There are typically no courses outside of music with these degrees.
			In most cases, professional musicians will take on this degree track
			to further sharpen their skills. The students of these degrees are
			generally already authorities in their field.</P>

		<h3>Which degree is right for you?</h3>
		<P>The right music degree for you is whichever helps you achieve your goals.
			Just like knowing which is the right music school, the perfect degree
			should help you embrace your particular interests above all else.</P>
