		<h2 class="article-sub-title" >The Value of Private Lessons</h2>
		<p>Private lessons show educational institutions a student is making an extra effort to improve their
			musical knowledge and performance skills. And lessons are also worth scholarship money!</p>
		<p>Rehearsals in school are valuable because they allow students to collaborate with other students
			and work on the performance for their next big concert. However, the time directors have to
			work one-on-one with a student during rehearsals can be limited. Private instruction can be a
			solution, but it comes at a cost: professional sessions can cost $100 per hour or more.</p>
		<p>Here are a few creative ways to get a student an affordable private lesson:</p>
		
		<h3>Use FREE online resources, like YouTube.</h3>
		<p>There are a lot of music professionals (even instructors within higher education) that post videos on <a target="_new" href="https://www.youtube.com/" >YouTube</a>. Make a list of instructors and share with your student.</p>
		
		<h3>Seek more experienced students as instructors.</h3>
		<p>Contact an instructor at a college or university nearby to see if they have any upper level students they would recommend to teach your child. Many collegiate programs require students to have an internship or a teaching practicum as part of their course of study. If your student is in middle school, check with the high school band director for a student who might be capable and responsible enough to provide private lessons.</p>
		
		<h3>Create a learning group.</h3>
		<p>If there is a group of students seeking private lessons, you can try arranging a group session among families. Have an instructor give one student a private lesson each week (and that family pays for it that week), while the other students observe as an informational session. Although only one student might be receiving a lesson each week, the other students will be able to observe and learn the methods or topics discussed and apply them as they practice.</p>
		
		<h3>Finally, seek scholarship opportunities.</h3>
		<p>Local clubs within the community, such as Rotary Clubs, Civitan Clubs, or even music societies, could provide financial assistance in the form of scholarships. You could also ask within your church. Many congregations are known to help fund music lessons or have someone that can provide lessons for little or no charge.  </p>
		<p>Colleges and universities value students who take private studies for two reasons. It shows that a student is making an extra effort to improve either their musical knowledge or performance skills. And the other being that <a target="_new" href="https://www.accoladi.com/2018/10/26/camping-for-scholarships/" >lessons are also worth scholarship money</a>.  </p>
		<p>Don’t let your geographical location or budget limit a student’s opportunity to have private lessons. With some creativity, you can find local opportunities. Instill the motto, "I won’t settle for how things are," in your student by helping them receive lessons. Lead by example. Teach them there is always room for improvement; learning new things is important.</p>
