		<h2 class="article-sub-title" >How to Prepare for What You’ve Never Seen</h2>
		<p>You may be wondering what kind of music you’ll be asked to play for the sight-reading portion of your audition. It’s really hard to guess because composing software lets anyone create a unique composition in a matter of minutes! If you are confronted with a brand-new composition a graduate student created just before your audition slot, never fear. I have some tips that will help you excel. I have examples from two schools that you might run into anywhere that you audition.</p>
		
		<h3>Example 1</h3>
		<p>A university in the Midwest uses an innovative method. They review your repertoire list, etude studies, scales and arpeggios. After the review, a graduate student uses your data to create two contrasting pieces derived from your list. For example, a clarinet auditioner may list:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>An 8th grade performance of "Chanson Moderne" by Hovey and Leonard</li>
			<li>A 10th grade performance of "Concerto in G Minor" by Handel arranged by Waln</li>
			<li>An 11th grade performance of "Dance Preludes" by Lutoslawski</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Based on that list, the graduate student will arrange a 64-measure composition which will include excerpts from these selections tied together by variations of traditional scale patterns. You can expect the scales to be presented in a non-traditional way which will lead to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>mixed meter patterns</li>
			<li>contrasting time signatures</li>
			<li>simple meter and compound meter</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Why do they do this? It helps the panel determine if you’re a solid sight reader or if you have memorized the solos. They are also looking to see if you can turn scale exercises into true musical expression.</p>
		
		<h3>Example 2</h3>
		<p>A university on the west coast creates three sight-reading compositions that, at first glance, all look the same. You may see no difference in the notes, meter, or key. But:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the title of each composition is different</li>
			<li>the dynamic markings are different</li>
			<li>the musical terms are different</li>
		</ul>

		<p>For instance, the first composition may be entitled "Danzón for a Texas Mix-Master," the second composition, "Lullaby for Charles Augustus Lindbergh, Jr.," and the third, "Scherzo con Brio." A glance at the metronome marking, contrast in musical terms, and title of the composition all present the style you should play in.</p>
		<p>Why do they do this? The audition adjudication panel looks for a keen music history knowledge, performance technique, and musical interpretation. What can you do to prepare? Remember the goal is to give a complete musical performance with your sight-reading.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Keep reviewing your past performance repertoire and reading past the notes, meter, and key.</li>
			<li>Take examples from your repertoire and write out your own two compositions from that material and your scales.</li>
			<li>Write out three compositions with the same meter, key, and note patterns and learn to perform your own works.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>Simply bringing all of your musical and performance techniques together will result in an outstanding sight-reading performance.</p>
