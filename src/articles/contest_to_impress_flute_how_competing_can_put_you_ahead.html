		<h2 class="article-sub-title" >How Competing Can Put You Ahead</h2>
		<p>Competing in and winning performance competitions is a great way to build your resume. College recruiters notice students’ awards and honors from contests. They show a student’s dedication to the craft. They can display musicians’ repertoire and experience working with accompanists. Especially in highly competitive instruments, competitions are a great way to stand out from peers. </p>
		<p>Flute competitions can help players garner attention from colleges since there are so many ways for them to shine. Flutists regularly play in wind ensembles, marching bands, and woodwind quintets. Players can also be in pit orchestras, extracurricular ensembles, or be soloists. When there are so many options, it can be hard to stand out. Participation in competitions accomplishes that. </p>
		<p>Generally speaking, the larger the applicant pool, the more weight the contests rewards will carry with a college recruiter. Every competition is different, and each has a different level of prestige. However, you benefit from participating in any competition. Below, we have included information about elite flute competitions available to high school students.</p>
