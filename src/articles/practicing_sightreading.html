			Audition adjudicators know
			that sightreading is an essential skill for musicians. Sightreading
			is a simple combination of music reading and music-making, all while
			looking at a piece of music for the first time. That&rsquo;s why
			sightreading is sometimes called a prima vista which is Italian for
			&quot;at first sight.&quot; Your sightreading performance says a lot
			about your musicianship because it shows musical knowledge as well as
			your performance technique.
		</P>

		<P>
			Why do a lot of students
			fear the sightreading part of an audition? Because most of them
			haven&rsquo;t:

		<UL>
			<LI>developed a personal systematic approach to sightreading</li>
			<LI>made sight-reading part of their daily practice</li>
			<LI>looked for professional instruction in the art of sightreading</li>
		</UL>

		<P>
			Make sight-reading part of
			your daily practice. A foundation for getting proficient at
			sightreading includes a good command of:

			<LI>rhythm</li>
			<LI>pitch accuracy</li>
			<LI>key signatures</li>
			<LI>musical styling</li>

		<h2>Recommendations on how to Practice SightReading </h2>

		<h3>6th Grade:</h3>
		<p>
			Using your beginning instruction book, demonstrate rhythm by counting
			and/or using the Gordon/Eastman technique out loud. Sing the pitches
			in solfege using hand signals.
		</P>

		<h3>7th Grade:</h3>
		<p>
			Keep practicing rhythm and pitch techniques by sightreading the bass
			of a piece, like a hymn. Play/sing the bass line in the clef
			appropriate for your instrument or voice part. Sightread the bass
			lines of 4 hymns each week. Hymnary.org is a great reference for
			notated hymns!
		</P>

		<h3>8th Grade:</h3>
		<p>
			Keep practicing rhythm and pitch techniques by sightreading each
			part/line of a hymn. Play/sing the part/lines for 4 hymns each week
			this year.
		</P>

		<h3>9th Grade: </h3>
		<p>
			By this year, you probably have a personal systematic approach to rhythm
			and pitch accuracy. Use it every time you sightread. This year, use
			ensemble concert literature, borrow other instrument or voice parts,
			and practice performing it in the clef appropriate for your
			instrument or voice part.
		</P>

		<h3>10th Grade:</h3>
		<p>
			Write out your own sixteen measure sightreading examples. Take the
			examples and give them five different musical stylings and tempo
			markings along with appropriate musical terms. Sightread one of these
			examples per day.
		</P>

		<h3>11th Grade:</h3>
		<p>
			Every day, sightread music composed for a different instrument. A
			good exercise is playing/singing the top line of a piano or
			conductor&rsquo;s score in your appropriate clef.
		</P>

		<P>
			You and your instructor
			may have a different way of practicing sightreading, but whatever
			approach you take, use it daily. Daily practice will increase your
			confidence and give you a systematic approach when it&rsquo;s time
			for the sightreading portion of your audition.
