		<P>There are a lot of ways to fund a
		college education. One large and under-used source is
		non-institutional (third-party) scholarships. Check out the terms
		below to learn about the different available sources.</P>

		<P><B>Institutional Scholarships </B>are
		awarded by higher education institutions. These scholarships and
		amounts are usually based on academic merit and/or need.</P>

		<P><B>Non-Institutional (third-party)
		Scholarships</B> are awarded through the private sector. This
		includes non-profit organizations, corporations, employers, religious
		organizations, ethnic or minority organizations, talent competitions,
		and civic organizations. Usually the scholarship will be paid
		directly to the college or university. The availability of these
		scholarships does require research because they are not always easy
		to find. Colleges are not required to tell prospective students about
		these scholarships. And sometimes there are stipulations: in or
		out-of-state residences, community services, essay submissions,
		students&rsquo; interests and talents, or availability only to
		non-traditional students.</P>

		<P><B>Federal Grants</B> are available and
		do not need to be repaid. Federal Grants are based on FAFSA
		information and are time-sensitive and limited. Federal Grants
		include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Education
		Opportunity Grants, Teacher Education Assistance, and Iraq and
		Afghanistan Service Grants.</P>

		<P><B>Financial Aid </B>is money that does
		not have to be paid back if it is awarded as a scholarship, grant, or
		federal work-study. In some cases, financial aid assistance will have
		to be paid back; but the stipulations are always clear from the
		onset.</P>

		<P><B>Loans</B>, whether government or
		private, are required to be paid back over time. Government loans are
		more lenient with grace periods, interest rates, interest schedules,
		and payment schedules than private lenders.</P>
