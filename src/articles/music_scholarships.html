		<p>You've invested immeasurable time, money, and energy in your musical education and performance development .  Now, wouldn't it be great if you could use your investment to help fund your college education? The good news is you can turn your experiences and talent into dollars.</p>
		<p>Colleges and universities offer fine arts scholarships to students willing to perform, even if they don’t major in music. Believe it or not, there are thousands of fine arts scholarships available if you just know where to look.  Accoladi helps students organize and showcase their musical achievements from 6th through 12th grades so colleges can find them and offer scholarships if they are willing to use their talents in the college ensembles.</p>
		<p>Colleges start looking for students as early as the 10th grade—and some begin tracking progress as early as the 8th grade. Even if you aren't ready to start planning for your college experience, recruiters are actively searching for their future scholarship students.  And what are these recruiters looking for? They are looking for students who: </p>

		<ul>
			<li>make good grades</li>
			<li>participate in numerous ensembles and productions</li>
			<li>take private lessons</li>
			<li>participate in summer enrichment experiences</li>
			<li>make All-State or regional ensembles</li>
			<li>complete commitments</li>
			<li>have a positive attitude</li>
		</ul>

		<p>It's never too early to start thinking about how you will fund your future college dreams and ambitions.  Wherever you are in this process, Accoladi is here to help you:</p>

		<p>Researching, applying, auditioning, and securing music scholarships is very different from academic and leadership scholarships.
