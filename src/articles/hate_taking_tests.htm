		<P>Preparing for and applying to colleges
		is stressful.  As graduation approaches, there are applications to
		complete, colleges to tour, and SAT and/or ACT exams to take.  And if
		you are a music student, the pressure is even higher.  You have long
		known that participation in music requires you to have more
		discipline, organization, and sacrifice than your fellow students who
		engage in basic general studies.  When other students are heading
		home or to McDonald&rsquo;s, you are preparing for after-school
		rehearsals, private lessons, contests, and even fundraisers to pay
		for these activities and opportunities.
		</P>

		<P>Now, you have decided to major in music
		or are planning to perform in collegiate ensembles in anticipation of
		receiving music scholarships to help with your collegiate expenses.
		This decision will make the path to your collegiate dreams look very
		different because as you&rsquo;re applying to the colleges you are
		hoping to attend, preparing for the ACT and/or SAT, you will also be
		preparing for your audition and music department entrance exam. </P>

		<P>If you could just eliminate one of
		these steps, your life would be so much easier! And you could give
		greater concentration to the steps remaining.  If somehow you could
		eliminate preparation for the ACT or SAT, preparing for your audition
		and music department entrance exam would be far less demanding.</P>

		<P>Some colleges and universities adopted
		a test-optional policy during the COVID-19 pandemic.  These colleges
		include the entire University of California system, Wake Forest
		University, Williams College, University of Chicago, and the
		University of Texas systems just to name a few.  As the COVID-19
		pandemic draws to a close, it appears the test-optional admissions
		will become permanent at some colleges and temporary at others.</P>

		<P>If you are not great at taking tests
		and/or want to spend more time in audition preparation, a
		test-optional college may just be what you need.  Here are four
		things to consider before you take this step.</P>

		<P><U><B>There Are Different Types of
		Test-Optional Institutions</B></U></P>

		<P><B>A test-optional
		college </B>allows students to decide whether they want to submit
		test scores with their applications.  Most test-optional schools will
		consider SAT and ACT scores if they are submitted but will focus on
		other factors they believe are stronger predictors of a student&rsquo;s
		potential to succeed in college.  These schools look at student
		essays, recommendations, grades, and coursework just as (or more)
		closely than test scores.  And if you are planning on majoring in
		music, additional major consideration is given to your audition and
		music department entrance exam outcomes.</P>

		<P><B>A test-flexible
		college </B>lets students submit other tests in place of the SAT or
		ACT, such as an International Baccalaureate exam or Advanced
		Placement test.</P>

		<P><B>A test-blind
		college</B> will not consider test scores, even if you submit them.</P>

		<P><U><B>Test-Optional Policies Differ
		from College to College</B></U></P>

		<P>The following are a
		few examples of test-optional policy restrictions:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>Some colleges require test scores for out-of-state students</LI>
			<LI>Some colleges only allow test-optional students if class rank is high enough</LI>
			<LI>Some colleges may ask the student to submit test scores to help determine class rank</LI>
			<LI>Some colleges may ask for twice the number of references</LI>
		</UL>

		<P>Be sure to check
		with the college to confirm how it will use test scores in the
		admission process.</P>


		<P><U><B>Other Parts of the Application
		Are Given Greater Weight</B></U></P>

		<P>Colleges want as
		much information about you as possible so they can make the best
		decision about your ability to fit in and succeed at their
		institution.  Without test scores, other parts of your application
		will very likely be under the microscope. Elements considered are, to
		name a few, class ranking starting in the 6<SUP>th</SUP> grade,
		essays, extracurricular activities; these elements must be very, very
		strong for the college to want to admit you.</P>


		<P><U><B>Test Scores May be Required for
		Merit Institutional Scholarships</B></U></P>

		<P>Many test-optional
		colleges look at test scores when awarding merit scholarships, so not
		submitting them may put you at a disadvantage.  Again, be sure to
		read about all scholarship requirements before entering this process
		and pay special attention to the requirements as they relate to SAT
		and/or ACT scores.  This may even be a requirement for a music or
		fine arts-related scholarship.</P>


		<P><U><B>Test Scores May be Required for
		Non-Institutional Scholarships</B></U></P>

		<P>Students majoring
		in music have a myriad of opportunities to apply, audition, and
		accept scholarship funds from private foundations, trusts, and civic
		and religious organizations, with amounts that can far exceed the
		merit scholarships that may be awarded by the institutions.  When
		making the decision to pursue acceptance into a college or university
		that is test-optional, make sure you&rsquo;ve not locked yourself out
		of opportunities with non-institutional scholarships.  Careful
		research is highly suggested before the decision is made to not take
		the SAT or ACT.</P>


		<P>Admittedly, the COVID-19 pandemic
		caused many alternatives to the traditional manner and systems to
		which we have become accustomed.  College recruiting and the
		application process is one of those situations that was forced to be
		reimagined. One of the major changes is the emergence of
		test-optional admission.  Time will only tell post-pandemic if this
		change will stick, and if it does, it may be a good option for you.
		If you decide to move toward a test-optional institution, make sure
		you are fully aware of all the future ramifications of the decision.
		It may very well prove to be a positive decision as you prepare for
		your audition and music department entrance exam.

		<P>Reminder: some
		schools will still require homeschooled students, students interested
		in merit aid or honors programs, and/or students applying to
		particular programs to submit an SAT or ACT score even if the
		university is otherwise test-optional; those distinctions will not be
		noted here. The best advice is to check the policies at the schools
		of your choice.</P>


		<P><I>Accoladi
		realizes that any college, university, and/or conservatory may change
		their policy concerning test-optional admission, and Accoladi accepts
