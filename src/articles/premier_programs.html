			The American collegiate system is
			renowned throughout the world and remains the number one destination
			for international students. The collegiate marketing and ranking
			system verifies the prestige of an institution standing based on
			comparative factors that are often never made public. However, the
			<I><B>U.S. News and World Report</B></I> college rankings are viewed
			as the gold standard of general college rankings lists. Its list is
			the most well-known and referenced.
		</P>


		<P>
			Here is a basic overview of how <I><B>U.S. News and World Report</B></I> determines its rankings:
		</P>
		<UL>
			<LI>A total weight of 40% is given to factors related to &ldquo;outcomes,&rdquo; such as student retention and graduation rates.</LI>
			<LI>20% is attributed to a school&rsquo;s faculty resources, based on five factors: class size, faculty salary, faculty with the highest degree in their field, student-faculty ratio, and faculty who are full time. </LI>
			<LI>20% is based on expert opinion - what top academics (presidents, provosts, deans of admissions) at peer institutions think of the school.</LI>
			<LI>Financial resources account for 10% of the ranking. This includes the average spending per student on instruction, student services and related expenses.</LI>
			<LI>7% is based on student excellence, which includes the standardized test scores, class rank and high school GPAs of admitted students.</LI>
			<LI>The final 3% is based on alumni giving, or how much money alums with bachelor&rsquo;s degrees from the school gave during the past few years.</LI>
		</UL>


		<P>
			There are also lists of ranked
			collegiate music programs, with multiple top twenty-five or top fifty
			lists. Some lists rank by instrument or vocal performance disciplines
			such as opera, musical theater, classical and/or pop. The criteria
			are usually based on historical ranking in the past ten years, number
			of applicants and alumni/foundational giving from the past five
			years. These top twenty-five or fifty ranking lists rarely change,
			and the researchers typically do not reveal the exact weighted
			percentages for their decision criteria.
		</P>

		<P>
			At Accoladi we believe that excellent
			teaching is happening on every campus across America, but students
			need better guidelines when comparing one School of Music with
			another. The seasoned professional music educators and music industry
			producers at Accoladi have devised a criteria for evaluation of
			schools of music called our <B>Premier Programs</B> and it is as
			follows:
		</P>

		<UL>
			<LI>A total weight of 45% is given to schools of music (music departments) where their faculty has had previous careers as professional performers, conductors, composer/arrangers and/or educators.</LI>
			<LI>25% to those who in the past three years have had students who achieved professional acclaim as  performers, conductors, creatives and/or educators.</LI>
			<LI>25% for schools with faculty members with multiple degrees such as a PhD or a DMA.</LI>
			<LI>5% for schools that are accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music.</LI>
		</UL>

		<P>
			These criteria responsibly recognize
			music schools across America no matter their ranking history or their
			alumni or foundational giving. <B>Premier Programs</B> gives
			prospective students a solid footing for discovering which schools
			will be the best fit and partner in pursuit of their collegiate and
			career aspirations.
