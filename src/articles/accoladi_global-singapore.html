		<h2 CLASS="western">Overview</h2>
		<P>Though many may think that studying internationally is only for the wealthy,
		studying in a foreign country may actually be more affordable for the
		average family than studying in the United States. Singapore is a
		great option for those wishing to study overseas because of its
		affordability, highly ranked schools, and it&apos;s distinct
		culture.</P>

		<h2 CLASS="western">Visa Requirements</h2>
		<P>A student visa is required for international study in Singapore.  The
		Singaporean &apos;student pass&apos; is only necessary if the
		course of study is longer than 30 days.  All student pass
		applications should be submitted through a system called SOLAR
		(Student&apos;s Pass Online and Registration). Before applying, an
		admission letter from a university in Singapore is required.  The
		application along with the acceptance letter must be submitted at
		least a month before the start of the academic year.  If under the
		age of 20 the applicant is not required to interview with the
		Embassy, but if the applicant is 20 years old or older the Embassy
		usually will request an interview. The processing time varies from
		applicant to applicant, usually around 2 weeks to a month.  In some
		rare cases the Singapore Immigration and checkpoints authority
		requires additional information, which could elongate the process to
		about 4 months.  The required materials for the visa can be found
		here: <a target="_new" href="https://www.edarabia.com/how-get-student-visa-singapore/"   ><U>https://www.edarabia.com/how-get-student-visa-singapore/</U></A>
		</P>

		<h2 CLASS="western">Compared to the United States</h2>
		<P>In order to see the benefits of studying in Singapore, let&apos;s
		compare three Singaporean universities to three American
		universities.  We will compare 4 small conservatories and then 2
		slightly larger institutions on factors such as tuition, total cost,
		curriculum, and extracurricular and performance opportunities.</P>

		<H3 CLASS="western">Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts vs Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music</H3>
		<P>The first two Universities that we&apos;ll compare are: Nanyang Academy
		of Fine Arts, Singapore and Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music
		which is located in Cincinnati, Ohio.  In terms of population, NAFA
		is slightly larger with  more than 2,000 undergraduates, CCM has
		about 1,430.  Both institutions have small but highly accredited
		music programs.  CCM offers a BA in Music as well as a BM.  Both
		include their own unique specializations, and both are 4 year
		programs.  Within CCM&apos;s BA in music degree they offer a vast
		array of classes, allowing the student to choose their own focus
		throughout the degree. CCM&apos;s BM is much more specialized, and
		requires that the student take emphasis specific courses. On that, a
		student studying the oboe will take mostly different classes than a
		Music education major. There are a few classes that fall under both
		specializations, such as theory or musicianship.  The BM at the NAFA
		differs from CCM&apos;s because it is only 2 years. The NAFA BM
		offers several specializations that CCM&apos;s does not, such as:
		composition, music therapy, and creating music for theater. </P>

		<P>The National Academy of the Fine Arts&apos;  BM offers many of the same
		opportunities as the Cincinnati conservatory of music but for a
		fraction of the cost.  If a student at NAFA uses Singapore's
		educational grant, then they could attend the two year program for
		$7560 per year, tuition whereas in Cincinnati a student can find
		themselves paying $13,917. Even after the cost of living, travel, and
		miscellaneous fees are considered, the total cost of NAFA sits around
		$7000 less than at CCM. And included in NAFA&apos;s tuition is the
		room and board of a 7-week residential visit to either the Royal
		Academy of Music in London or a 10-week visit to the Central
		Conservatory of Music in Beijing. </P>

		<H2 CLASS="western">Yong Siew Toh Conservatory vs San Francisco
		Conservatory of Music</H2>
		<P>Next let's compare Yong Siew Toh Conservatory and San Francisco
		Conservatory of Music. YSTC is located in Singapore and SFCM is
		located in San Francisco, California. YSTC total undergraduate
		population<FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">*
		is 220, similarly SFCM&apos;s population is about 233 students.
		These schools make up for their lack of size with high quality
		learning. These schools are very similar into terms of acceptance
		rate, size, and ranking. But what sets Yong Siew Toh apart is its
		price. Many music schools that are the same size and pedigree as Yong
		Siew Toh are nearly double the price. And this reigns true in the
		case of SFCM, who&apos;s tuition is a staggering $49,000 and $76,675
		total. YSTC&apos;s tuition is $23,569 and $32,927 for international
		students which seems much more reasonable.</P>

		<P>Both of these Conservatories offer a Bachelors in Music, but SFCM&apos;s
		program has a plethora of specializations. This is part of the reason
		that SFC&apos;s tuition fee is so high. Also at SFCM within the BM
		in Piano or Organ, there is a big emphasis on private instruction. It
		makes up the bulk of the total 127 credit hours necessary to
		graduate. Furthermore, included within the major is 30 hours of
		Humanities and Sciences, making the curriculum very well rounded. At
		YSTC the bulk of the BM&apos;s curriculum is made up of &apos;major
		study&apos;, specifically 52 of the total 160 modular credits are
		&apos;major study&apos;. Major study at YSTC can be a number of
		different courses, they are major specific and build off of each
		other from semester to semester.
		</P>

		<P>Outside of the BM curriculum at YSTC and SFCM, it is encouraged that students
		engage in extracurricular music activities. This includes activities
		like: joining ensembles, participating in the shows put on by other
		departments, or joining the conservatory orchestra.
		</P>

		<P>*<I>Yong Seiw Toh is apart of the National Singapore University whose total
		undergraduate population is about 25,000</I>.</P>

		<H2 CLASS="western">Lasalle College of the Arts
		vs Chapman University</H2>
		<P>Now we&apos;ll compare 2 slightly larger institutions: Lasalle College
		of the Arts and Chapman University. More specifically Chapman&apos;s
		Hall-Musco Conservatory of Music. Chapman is the larger of the two
		schools with 7,505 undergraduate students, LCA is less than half the
		size with 2700 undergrad students. Much like the undergrad
		population, Chapman&apos;s tuition is $58,250 whereas LCA&apos;s
		tuition is $18,340. The total estimated costs for Chapman are $71,330
		and for LCA&apos;s total estimated costs are $29,836. These costs
		include living expenses, tuition, fees, and travel costs. Furthermore
		the BA in Music program at LCA is only 3 years meaning that students
		only need to pay tuition for 3 years rather than 4 years at Chapman. </P>

		<P>Chapman offers both a Bachelors of Music as well as a BA in Music. LCA offers
		only the ladder. Chapmans BA in music has no specializations and
		focuses on students being well rounded musicians and musicologists.
		On the other hand their BM degree offers several unique performance
		majors as well as composition. The BM majors allow their students to
		specialize in a specific field and gain real world experience as well
		as join and participate in ensemble performances. On the contrary
		LCA&apos;s BA in music program does offer a number of
		specializations. Each specialization is separated into 3 levels and
		the courses get more industry specific as the students move up in
		level. </P>

		<P>When comparing Chapman and LCA, the biggest difference is the price. Even
		with the cost of travel, living expenses, and extra spending money
		the total cost of attending Chapman University as a music student is
		much more expensive. </P>

		<h2 CLASS="western">Conclusion</h2>
		<P>As the tables show, any student can receive a quality education in
		Singapore just like in the United States. The only difference is the
		cost. Singapore&apos;s government heavily grant a subsidised tuition
		for local and international students making almost all of their
		secondary schooling much more affordable</P>
