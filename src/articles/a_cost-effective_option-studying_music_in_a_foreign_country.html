		<P>As the cost of education continues to rise in the United States, many
		Americans are less able to afford a college education. They
		don&rsquo;t have the resources to pay high costs and are ineligible
		for financial aid. Because of this, going to a good college,
		and more specifically, a good music college, is less and less an
		option for the everyday American. Students and families are forced to
		choose between crippling student debt and no college education at
		all. But, from this dilemma rises a possible remedy: studying
		in another country.</P>

		<P>Initially, studying in another country may sound like an option only for the
		wealthy, but this is not the case. Many countries, like South
		Africa and Singapore, have significantly lower education costs and
		can be a good option for American students who cannot afford an
		American university. For example, tuition can start at $1,500
		at North-West University in South Africa before scholarships and
		aid. This compares to the average university tuition costs in
		America ranging from $11,200 for in-state students at public colleges
		to $50,000 at private schools.</P>

		<P>Studying internationally is made even more accessible by the fact that many
		foreign universities are not only accredited in the United States,
		but also are eligible for American financial aid through FAFSA.
		In other words, American students can receive federal financial aid
		for many international universities that can help offset the costs of
		travel and tuition. Plus, there are many non-institutional
		scholarships available that can be applied to accredited foreign
		colleges, resource for reducing already low tuition costs for
		students seeking to study internationally.</P>

		<P>Despite the low costs of tuition, one common concern for those considering
		studying internationally is the costs and requirements of
		international travel, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic.
		Depending on the market, a plane ticket can cost between $400 and
		$1,000 per flight, and depending on the country, student visas can
		cost between $50 and $400. Additionally, some countries require
		an in-person interview at their embassy or consulate, which can add
		more travel costs. While these costs are considerable, the
		tuition alone for an American university is much more expensive than
		the overall costs of many foreign universities (including admissions,
		tuition, housing, travel, food, etc.).</P>

		<P>Since most Americans only speak English, another concern is language.
		While many countries do not speak English in their universities, many
		non-English speaking countries actually require their universities to
		teach classes in English. Many of these countries are
		multilingual and use English as a common language, such as Singapore
		and South Africa. Additionally, there are &ldquo;American
		universities&rdquo; across the world, in which they speak English.
		These universities, in countries like Egypt, Lebanon, and Hungary,
		emulate the American style of education - at a lower price.</P>

		<P>Studying in a foreign country can save money both in the short term and the
		long term and can provide valuable experience to American students
		seeking to step outside their comfort zone. And, while there
		are costs associated with studying internationally, a foreign
		university could be a more affordable option for American students
		than an American university.</P>
