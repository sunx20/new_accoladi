		<p>The price of college tuition is rising every year, and students need scholarships now more than ever. Although you may know about university-funded scholarships, you should also consider non-institutional (third-party) scholarships. Organizations and foundations not affiliated with colleges and universities manage and distribute these funds.</p>
		<p>Qualifying for these scholarships is as simple as having connections to local or national organizations or living in a specific city, county, or state. You can also receive a non-institutional (third-party) scholarship for being a member of certain clubs or groups, like Rotary or Kiwanis Clubs and Credit Unions. Many of these applications are available in high school guidance offices. There are lots of scholarships you can apply for if you know the right places to look. Keep applying because approximately $1.25 billion in scholarship money goes unused every year!</p>
		<h4>How to Find Non-Institutional (third-party) Scholarships</h4>
		<p>Now that you know what non-institutional (third-party) scholarships are, you might be wondering: how do I find them? A good way to start is to look at organizations that you or your family are a part of. For example, if you or someone in your family has been in the military, the fire department, or employed by local businesses, talk to a representative of the organization or look on their website to see if they offer educational scholarships.</p>
		<p>Many high school clubs and programs also offer scholarships to students. Talk to your teachers and see if they can help you find scholarship applications related to your clubs, such as Tri-M or National Honor Society. There are also scholarships for students who attend specific high schools donated by alumni. Accoladi subscribers have access to our searchable database of over 16,500 scholarships, ranging from $50 to a full-ride.</p>
