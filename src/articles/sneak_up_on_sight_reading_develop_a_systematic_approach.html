		<h2 class="article-sub-title" >Develop a Systematic Approach</h2>
		<p>Audition adjudicators know that sight-reading is an essential skill for musicians. Sight-reading is a simple combination of music reading and music-making, all while looking at a piece of music for the first time. That’s why sight-reading is sometimes called a prima vista which is Italian for "at first sight." Your sight-reading performance says a lot about your musicianship because it shows musical knowledge as well as your performance technique.</p>
		<p>Why do a lot of students fear the sight-reading part of an audition? Because most of them haven’t:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>developed a personal systematic approach to sight-reading</li>
			<li>made sight-reading part of their daily practice</li>
			<li>looked for professional instruction in the art of sight-reading</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>That won’t happen to you because you are going to learn how to get better at sight-reading. You won’t need to get as nervous before your audition because you’ll have a plan.</p>
		<p>You might have guessed I recommend making sight-reading part of your daily practice. A foundation for getting proficient at sight-reading includes a good command of:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>rhythm</li>
			<li>pitch accuracy</li>
			<li>key signatures</li>
			<li>musical styling</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>As you get older and better at those skills, make sure to add in the guidelines below.</p>
		
		<h3>How to Practice</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>6th Grade:</b>&nbsp;Using your beginning instruction book, demonstrate rhythm by counting and/or using the Gordon/Eastman technique out loud. Sing the pitches in solfege using hand signals.</li>
			<li><b>7th Grade:</b> Keep practicing rhythm and pitch techniques by sight-reading the bass of a piece, like a hymn. Play/sing the bass line in the clef appropriate for your instrument or voice part. Sight-read the bass lines of 4 hymns each week. Hymnary.org is a great reference for notated hymns!</li>
			<li><b>8th Grade:</b> Keep practicing rhythm and pitch techniques by sight-reading each part-line of a hymn. Play/sing the part-lines for 4 hymns each week this year.</li>
			<li><b>9th Grade:</b> By this year, you probably have a personal systematic approach to rhythm and pitch accuracy. Use it every time you sight-read. This year, use ensemble concert literature, borrow other instrument or voice parts, and practice performing it in the clef appropriate for your instrument or voice part.</li>
			<li><b>10th Grade:</b>&nbsp;Write out your own sixteen measure sight-reading examples. Take the examples and give them five different musical stylings and tempo markings along with appropriate musical terms. Sight-read one of these examples per day.</li>
			<li><b>11th Grade:</b>&nbsp;Every day, sight read music composed for a different instrument. A good exercise is playing/singing the top line of a piano or conductor’s score and play each line of the score in your appropriate clef.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>That’s our guide on how to practice sight-reading. There’s nothing magic about it. It’s just one way to do it. You and your instructor may have a different way, but whatever approach you use, use it daily. Daily practice will increase your confidence and give you a systematic approach when it’s time for your sight-reading audition.</p>
