		<p>The preparation needed to apply and audition to become a collegiate music major or using your musical talents to become a collegiate ensemble member desiring supportive music scholarships is a long and rigorous journey. While you are experiencing the closing out of your high school career you are anticipating your collegiate possibilities. And these possibilities are wrapped in college visits and applications. And then, with your musical aspirations, add to this scenario an additional application to the school of music, an audition, and a school of music entrance exam, and it can look overwhelming.</p>
		<p>However, you are determined, and you start out well with the process. But there is so much to do and very little time to accomplish all the objectives and goals set before you. It can become discouraging. You cannot let discouragement take hold even for a few moments resulting in you losing your momentum. No, you will have to be able to motivate yourself, awaken your enthusiasm and driving power.
		</p>
		<h3>First, what is motivation?</h3>
		<p>Motivation is an inner driving force that pushes people to accomplish things. It manifests as a strong desire, ambition, because you must believe what you want to do is important. It is the desire to act and accomplish goals. It is enthusiasm for doing; it’s encouragement, self-confidence, and an optimistic state of mind. </p>
		<h3>Second, why do we need motivation?</h3>
		<p>If you wish to accomplish goals, you will need a driving force. Otherwise, nothing will happen. Wishing is not strong enough to drive you to take action. A wish is a weak desire, and only a strong desire can make you move forward, act and accomplish goals. Getting motivated supplies enthusiasm, ambition, drive, and incentive.</p>
		<p>When you get motivated, your life takes a different path. You become a doer, and you increase your potential to succeed. You need this dose of energy and push to excel as a performer, especially when it comes to daily practice, learning the fundamentals of music theory, a myriad of musical terms, and some basic music history, all while practicing your solo, scales, and sightreading.</p>
		<p>You must think that your goals as a future collegiate performer can and will come true. See yourself performing in the college ensemble you’ve got your hopes pinned on. See yourself getting off the plane in Rome as part of this ensemble’s summer European tour. Yes, if you can see it, you can be it.
		</p>
		<p>Motivation requires action: write your weekly goals down and use them as screen savers on your computer. So, every time you turn on your computer or iPad, they serve as a reminder that you have a contract with yourself.</p>
		<p>You have to be your own cheerleader if you want to become a stronger musician, especially as you consider and prepare for your collegiate audition. Thinking and persuading yourself of the importance of what you want to achieve will increase your motivation, strengthen your desire, and make you determined to do whatever it takes to accomplish your goals.</p>
		<h3>Motivation Assignment</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Visualize yourself performing in your first collegiate concert. </li>
			<li>What ensemble are you a member of?
			</li>
			<li>What repertoire is this ensemble playing or singing at this concert?
			</li>
			<li>Who are all the people beaming with pride at your accomplishment and are attending this concert to support you?
			</li>
			<li>Following the concert, how will you celebrate this milestone in your life?
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Remember, if you can see it, you can be it!</p>
