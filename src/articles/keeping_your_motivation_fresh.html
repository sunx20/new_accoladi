		<p>As a performing musician you are in the business of taking on projects that you presently do not have the skill sets to perform. Your next composition is beyond your abilities and it is your task to master this composition whether it is a solo piece or an ensemble piece. And that requires a great deal of alone time in private practice. In this practice time you must become your own time manager, your own evaluator of your progress and your own counselor for keeping your emotions in check. You have observed these lessons of time management, evaluation, and counseling from your director as he or she has taught your ensemble a new piece. </p>
		<p>You may be in the process of deciding on whether you want to major in music and prepare yourself for a career in a music related industry. If so, it is going to require a great deal of effort to apply for admission in the college, university, or conservatory you choose. And then, there is the additional application, audition, and entrance exam you must complete specifically for the school of music. On top of all of this is the process of securing grants, loans, scholarships and other financial aid to pay for it all. Admittedly, it’s a lot but it doesn’t have to be overwhelming.
		</p>
		<p>So, the battle is in the mind before it is ever in the practice room. To be well prepared for the collegiate music process you must demonstrate self-awareness and confidence to meet these new challenges.
		</p>
		<p>Tell yourself, “<i><b>YOU CAN DO THIS</b></i>!” You must start with the word believe. Remember the famous saying “<i>If you Believe it, you can Achieve it</i>”
		</p>
		<p>So, what is the pathway from Believe to Achieve?</p>
		<h3>Use Your Imagination
		</h3>
		<p>Visualize your goal as already accomplished and shut your mind to doubts and disbelief. True, it might not be easy, as doubts and disbelief will probably try to occupy your mind. However, with persistence, you can teach your mind to stay away from doubts, or least ignore them.</p>
		<h3>Make Workable Plans
		</h3>
		<p>Plan small steps that are easy to follow and insist on taking at least one step a day. This will increase your confidence, and make you believe that big goals are within your reach.
			When you realize that just one step is doable, it will be easier to continue with more steps, and that will greatly help you keep up your motivation and enthusiasm.
		</p>
		<h3>Repeat Positive Affirmations
		</h3>
		<p>Positive Affirmations are words with power. When you need a dose of motivation, you will find it helpful to repeat positive affirmations. Here are two examples:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>“<i>I have the desire, enthusiasm inner strength to achieve my goal</i>.”</li>
			<li><i>“I feel great motivation and strong ambition within me</i>.”</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Repeat positive affirmations when you feel lack of motivation, with attention and belief.</p>
		<h3>Strengthen Your Willpower and Self-Discipline</h3>
		<p>Sometimes, you will need to carry out some important tasks, which you might not like doing. This often awakens inner resistance, and therefore, you might find it difficult to muster motivation. At times such as these you need to have enough willpower and self-discipline to get you through. Tell yourself you can achieve this goal.
		</p>
		<h3>Keep Your Desire Alive</h3>
		<p>Strive to keep the desire, enthusiasm, and zest constantly alive. Think of everything that can keep the flame alive within you. One of the simplest ways is to write down you goals and check them off one by one, and when you can see your past success it will fuel your energy and desire to reach another goal.
		</p>
		<h4>Summary</h4>
		<p>To make yourself “<i>Believe to Achieve</i>” you must realize foremost that the battle is in the mind. First, take action steps to visualize yourself achieving the goal set before you. Second, make a workable plan. Third, identify and speak affirmation to yourself. Fourth, strengthen your willpower and self-discipline especially on the days you want to quiet. And finally fifth, keep you desire alive.</p>
		<p>Affirm yourself always – YOU CAN DO THIS! Believe you can rise to new heights as a performer by taking control of your attitude and turning your emotional hurdles into daily victories until you have achieved your goal.
		</p>
		<h2>
			The Challenge: From Believe to Achieve
		</h2>
		<p>Challenge yourself to learn a new solo in 21 days. Write out a day-by-day workable plan with obtainable goals every three-days. Keep a daily journal of your process of learning this new composition. Make the daily journal entries reflective of your emotional process more than your musical process. The purpose of this exercise is to identify how well your plan measured your daily obtainable goals. It will highlight points of discouragement and how you managed them.</p>
		<p>Challenge Tips:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Limit your practice time to twenty minutes per day.</li>
			<li>Keep a daily journal of your 21-day journey. (<i>These daily journal entries should be more reflective of your emotional process than your musical proficiency process</i>.) </li>
			<li>Remember: YOU CAN DO THIS! You can rise to new heights as a performer by taking control of your attitude and turning your emotional hurdles into daily victories until you have achieved your goal. </li>
