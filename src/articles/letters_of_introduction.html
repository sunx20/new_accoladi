		<p>The following are letters that
			students have written to collegiate ensemble directors and studio instructors
			denoting their desire to be one of their future students:</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Ms. Horne,</p>
		<p>I sing! I sing Gospel, I sing Broadway, I sing Opera, I sing Classical, I sing Pop, I sing R&amp;B, I sing Choral, and I sing Blues. I am confident if you would become my voice instructor I would do it all better!</p>
		<p>Just Between Us Singers,</p>
		<p>Ebony Stackhouse</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Dr. William,</p>
		<p>I’m Sasha Connor, a rising junior at Greene Central High
			School, in Snow Hill, North Carolina.
			 Snow Hill is a small town with less than 1,000 people in Eastern, North
			Carolina and in all my sixteen years of living here I’ve
			only seen it snow here once. My life
			centers around school, church, and piano.
			 In fact, I am the accompanist for my high school chorus, and I play for
			every function at the First Baptist
			Church.</p>
		<p>I’ve been taking piano lessons since I was three. I started with the pianist at the First
			Baptist Church, and I took lessons from her until I was nine. She passed away and I then became the church
			pianist. The church paid for me to start
			taking piano lessons at East Carolina University in nearby Greenville. I started taking from the head of the piano
			faculty and did so until last year. He
			helped improve my technique and started having me compete in piano contests. In fact, I’ve  placed
			first in every competition I’ve entered.
			 He suggested that I change teachers last year to the new piano
			instructor who is a touring concert pianist.  When she is not teaching at the university she
			is traveling, performing as a recitalist and symphony soloist. With her help last year, I won the East
			Carolina Piano Festival Competition by performing Bela Bartok’s ‘Allegro <span class=SpellE>Barbaro .’ The prize for
			winning this competition is performing a concerto with the Long Bay Symphony in
			Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. I am
			working on the Alec Rawley’s ‘Miniature Concerto’ for this concert. </p>
		<p>It is my passion to someday perform the Edvard Grieg’s
			‘Concerto in A Minor.’ I see you have performed it many times with numerous
			symphonies across the world. If you are
			ever giving a Master Class on this concerto please let me know and I’ll be
			there. In addition, I have watched all
			your performances you’ve  posted on YouTube.com and
			would be deeply honored to be considered to be a student in your studio. Can you share with me the best path to one of
			these coveted spots?</p>
		<p>Hoping to Be One of Your Most Celebrated Students One Day,</p>
		<p>Sasha O’Connor</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Dr. Wu,</p>
		<p>I’m a rising senior percussionist at a fine arts high school
			in Florida. I’ve
			been selected the past two years as a member of the Florida All-State Band, and
			I have been selected to be one of the four percussionists with the American
			Youth Philharmonic Orchestra that will be performing at Carnegie Hall and
			touring China this summer. All these
			experiences, along with my personal commitment to becoming an excellent
			performer, have inspired my interest in becoming a professional performing
			percussionist.</p>
		<p> My research reveals
			that this was your life’s path for many years, and then you became an
			instructor to mentor young percussionists like myself. I am hoping this fall to secure an invitation
			to one of your weekend sessions on “Professional Percussionists Have Mastered
			It All.” Also, know how very much I want
			to be a part of your studio next year.
			 If you have suggestions on how I can prepare for the audition, please
			send me an email. Thank you for giving
			my request your personal attention.</p>
		<p>Sincerely,</p>
		<p>Donald Lloyd</p>

		<p>Dr. McIntyre,</p>
		<p>I love band! It’s  my whole life. I
			live for band every day. I’m  not the best trumpet player in Texas, but I am the best
			in my high school band. I have not been
			able to take private lessons other than the ones from my band director, Mr. Richardson. He gives so much to his students, and many
			times he has shared that everything he learned about teaching he learned from
			you. I also want to learn from you so
			that I can be a great and caring band director like Mr. Richardson. What are the best steps I can take to be in
			your band and become an instrumental music education major on your campus next
			year?</p>
		<p>Thanks,</p>
		<p>Russell Blaylock</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Dr. Littleton,</p>
		<p>I’m a homeschooled student and have played cello since I was
			in the 4<sup>th</sup> grade. My mother
			plays violin, my dad plays double bass, and they’ve
			taught me almost every day. I’m just a
			junior but I’m interested in becoming one of your students now and getting a
			head start on what it will be like when I’m one of your students my freshman
			year at TSU. When, and how, can we begin
			establishing this student – teacher relationship?</p>
		<p>Looking Forward to Hearing Back,</p>
		<p>Mia Floyd</p>
