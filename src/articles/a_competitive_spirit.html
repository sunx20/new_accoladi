		<p>You are a performer,  and part of being a performer is understanding that competition is very much a part of reaching your goals as a performer. Most of our middle and high school music programs across the United States focus mainly on competition.</p>
		<p>You understand it fully: you compete for a chair, you compete for a solo, and/or you may compete for a specific role in a performance. Your marching band is out almost every weekend in the fall competing for a trophy and to carry the title of the First Place Champions. Or your showchoir is competing from January to March all across your region seeking to get the medal as Grand Champions. And then you practice and practice those prescribed requirements for receiving a superior at your state’s Solo and Ensemble Festival, or for a coveted spot in one of the All-State ensembles in your state. Yes, you live for the competition.</p>
		<p>If you’re considering becoming a music major in college, or you are wanting to use your musical talents to become a collegiate ensemble member but desiring to major in something other than music, then no matter your collegiate motives there is an audition in in your future. And have no misconceptions about the audition process; it is extremely competitive. You will be competing against others for the limited number of admission spots for your instrument or voice part and you are competing for scholarship dollars. Although you are competing against other applicants the person that you are competing against the most is yourself.</p>
		<p>You must realize if you are going to be a successful competing collegiate auditionee then your competition is not against other people, it is against your procrastination, your lack of self-esteem, your ego, the knowledge you neglect, your lack of creativity, the negative behavior you are nurturing, your lack of discipline, and your lack in believing you can achieve any goal. Yes, that is what you must compete against. You see, the competition is against the person you were yesterday.</p>
		<p>So, challenge yourself to achieve more from your individual practice sessions. Challenge yourself to learn a solo that is beyond your present performing abilities. Challenge yourself to be creative by writing a song or composing a solo for your instrument. Challenge yourself to learn two-hundred musical terms and their definitions. And daily challenge your sightreading abilities.</p>
		<p>If you can challenge yourself at this deep level then you are going to be a solid competitor in winning that coveted spot in the school of music in your college of choice, winning that position in the collegiate ensemble you’ve dreamed of being a member of, and winning solid scholarship funds. The question is . . . are you up for the challenge?</p>
		<p>Remember, the greatest winners in life are those who know how to compete against themselves and celebrate the victories they win over who they were yesterday.</p>
		
		<h3>Challenge Your Competitive Spirit</h3>
		<p>Challenge yourself by creating your own competition. First, name your competition. Then write out the audition requirements, write out the rules for judging yourself, set the dates for the prelims and the finals. Make your own award (trophy). Write out what the awards ceremony will look like and what you will be wearing for this event. And when the time comes, record your own awards ceremony and post on YouTube.</p>
