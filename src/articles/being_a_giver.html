		<p>As a scholastic musical performer, you have learned to be a “<i>giver</i>.” You give of yourself and your abilities to perform in an ensemble. You give of yourself in private practice to make sure that you can play or sing every note with rhythmic accuracy, centered pitch, and the correct stylistic musical expression. You give of your time by making room in your schedule for all the rehearsals and performances that have been requested of you as a part of a performing musical ensemble. Yes, you have learned how to be a giver. </p>
		<p>Google the words “<i>give</i>” and “<i>giver</i>” and see what you might find. You may find some quotes like these:</p>
		<p>“<i>No one has ever become poor by giving</i>.” – Ann Frank</p>
		<p>“<i>Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more</i>” – Jackson Brown</p>
		<p>“<i>We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give</i>.” – Winston Churchill</p>
		<p>“<i>The meaning of life is to find your gift. The purpose of life is to give it away</i>.” - Pablo Picasso</p>
		<p>If you are considering being a professional performing artist, you must take into consideration the mountain of giving that is ahead of you. You must give of yourself to walk through the college undergraduate degree, and for many performers, it will also require a master’s degree. You will find yourself during the collegiate experience giving of yourself not to just one director like you had in high school but to several directors each coming with their own idiosyncrasies. And then as you move from the collegiate world to the professional world you will find yourself giving not only to the director or conductor but to the company that hires you to perform. This company will come with an executive producer who will make additional demands. Some of those demands will be to be involved in public relations with the community, others may include being involved in logistical concerns, while still others may be involving advertising and media appearances. Then you are going to be asked to fit into the existing structure of your fellow performers, honoring the seasoned performers while assimilating yourself into the ensemble’s culture. This is a great deal of giving outside the daily requirements of becoming a stronger more proficient musical performer.</p>
		<p>If you are considering becoming a music educator, you must consider all the giving that will be required of you. You will have to give of yourself through the collegiate process with directors of performing organizations, the overseers in your becoming a certified teacher, and the coordinating teacher under whom you will student teach. Then once hired as a music educator you will be giving yourself daily to be ready with instructional material and creativity to ensure the musical skills are developing with your students. </p>
		<p>On a more personal basis, you will be giving to your students by being a mentor in their overall personal development. You are going to be giving of yourself to fit into the overall culture of the school you are going to be working in, as well as giving to the wishes and desires of your administrators. There are two other groups that you are going to find yourself giving to that are going to be taxing of your time and energy. The first of these groups are parents of your students, whether it is in the role of co-parenting their child through their musical journey or in the role of major supporter and co-coordinator of goals, objectives, and events of your school’s music booster program. You are also going to be asked to be a part of professional music educators’ organizations such as your state’s band, orchestra, or choral directors associations as well as the overall state music educators association. The demand of your time as a music educator can seem overwhelming.</p>
		<p>So, the question arises: are you a giver? Do you need to work at the art of giving before making the decision to major in music and eventually becoming a professional musical performer or music educator? This is a part of your personality that must be explored and/or developed. Yes, you are a musician, and part of being a musician is giving. </p>
		<h3>Being A Giver</h3>
		<p>Complete one of the following giving acts and/or create your own giving act and document.</p>
		<h4>Suggested giving acts:</h4>
		<p>Volunteer to give six lessons to a beginning instrumentalist who plays your instrument or beginning vocalist who sings your vocal part. </p>
		<p>Video yourself singing three folk songs and share with young singers and encourage them to sing along with you.</p>
		<p>Give a recital for residents of a local nursing home. Make it personal to the residents of this facility by dedicating a selection to them by name. This will require you to work with the nursing home’s activities coordinator and learning from this person the kinds of music their residents like. Also learn some of names of the residents and their favorite songs. This recital should not be about the music you know, or the recital selections you are preparing for your collegiate auditions, but rather about the people you are performing for. Then create an invitation to invite them to the recital. In addition, have a plan ready to make pictures with them following the recital.</p>
