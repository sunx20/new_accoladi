			I was on
			Ancestry.com and see that I may be a relative to at least two of your faculty
			members. They have no idea that we’re related, but if I bring in the
			results from Ancestry.com can we get on the faculty – family reduced tuition
			plan?
		</p>

		<p>
			Do they supply free birth control through the student health clinic?
		</p>

		<p>
			Your school
			is world-renowned for your engineering program and you accept very few students
			into that program. So, if my child comes in as a music major with
			the goal of transferring to the engineering program, how long do they
			have to be a music major before they can transfer?
		</p>

		<p>
			My child’s
			dream is to be on Broadway, and you can see from her resume
			the leading roles she has played in her high school and community theater.
			You will have to admit it will be a real coup for your school to get
			her as a student. So, I am simply asking that before she
			accepts your invitation to become a student here that you sign a contract
			that I got off legalzoom.com guaranteeing her a leading role in at least one
			musical by her sophomore year and a leading role in every year following.
			She will put your school’s name on her Playbill bio if you sign this contract.
		</p>

			My child
			had a really bad experience with a private lesson teacher. This teacher
			asked way too much of his time and energy. Can we
			devise a degree plan for him where he does not have to take
			private studio lessons?
		</p>

		<p>
			I understand
			that the ensembles in your music department go on tour every spring, but my
			child still gets car sick and sometimes still wets the bed. Because
			of these issues, can we go ahead and plan for my child not to be
			required to go on tour?
		</p>

		<p>
			What is the
			party scene like on this campus? My child has already been arrested once
			for a DUI and I just don’t want to put him in a place
			where he may be drinking.
		</p>

		<p>
			My
			girlfriend and I are both planning on attending school
			here. We’re going to live off campus together so can we be
			assured that we can room together while on tour?
		</p>

		<p>
			I smoke pot
			and it really helps my academic performance. Since you now know
			this, can I be assured that my professors will let me know about
			pop-quizzes a day in advance so I can get a good drag in before I
			take the pop-quiz? Like I said, it really enhances my academic
			performance.
		</p>

		<p>
			My child is
			an excellent piano player, but he only plays music
			that has no black notes. How can we be guaranteed
			that he will be given only white note music?
		</p>

		<p>
			We’ve narrowed
			down our discussion to three schools, two are within an hour’s drive from our
			house and this school is a four-hour drive. I know that your wife is from
			our town, and the two of you have no children, so do you
			think it would be inappropriate if I were to ask that when you
			and your wife come home to Greenwood my child could ride home with you?
			This could help sway our decision.
		</p>

		<p>
			For the cost of this school, do you provide free valve oil and mute?
		</p>


		<p>
			I see that
			you have only a master’s degree and I understand you have performed at the
			Met, but how can I be guaranteed that my child will be taught only by
			people who have a doctorate? Or can we get a discount when professors
			with master’s only teach him?
