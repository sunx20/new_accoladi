		<p>In 1983 at the age of 23, on the 3rd day of his new job as the band director of a rural 1A high school in coastal South Carolina, Randall Bayne discovered it was Senior Day. His job was to help the 12 seniors in band class, whom he had just met, articulate for their yearbook pictures their greatest goal in life, in “no more than seven words.”</p>
		<p>One young man shared the dream of getting a new truck from the landowner for whom his parents sharecropped. After graduation, he would be making $50 weekly payments for a truck that he would own outright at the age of fifty. One young lady’s dream was to see the ocean, only a thirty-minute drive from school. Another young man’s goal was to eat at McDonald’s every Friday night of his life; he’d never been before. </p>
		<p>Upon hearing all of the depressingly similar responses, Mr. Bayne asked them about college and got blank stares. They could not imagine college in their futures. </p>
		<p>So, he loaded these seniors into the school van, and off they went. Their first stop was a car dealership where the young man learned a Chevy C10 Pickup could be paid for in five years. The next stop was McDonald’s, where everyone got whatever they wanted to eat. Then, on to the beach where that young girl got to see the ocean for the first time.</p>
		<p>Finally, the adventure ended at the Krispy Kreme donuts counter where Mr. Bayne made those seniors a solemn promise: if they would work hard the next few months, he would make sure they got into a college with a music major and scholarships to pay for it. </p>
		<p>For the next three months, he mentored these students at all hours of the day. They did their part, learning all the components necessary for a college audition. Focused and determined, these students began to believe in themselves and internalized a new dream into their personal stories.</p>
		<p>In September and October, they filled out a mountain of college applications. In January and February, they crammed into Bayne’s 1974 Chevrolet Maverick for weekend audition trips. In seven weeks, these 12 students auditioned collectively at seventeen colleges or universities.</p>
		<p>By the end of the process, all twelve students accomplished their goal and got into college with scholarships and grants. What’s more, each of them graduated with a degree. Now in their mid 50’s they are all working or retired from such careers as school district administrator, high school principal, trumpet player in the Air Force band, church musician, and band director. </p>
		<p>This experience, and others like it, opened Dr. Bayne’s eyes to untapped opportunities to create life-long success for all children and their families through unclaimed and readily available collegiate and non-institutional scholarship funding. Accoladi represents his commitment to making these dreams come true. Because of this experience, Bayne’s knowledge and passion for nationally leveling the playing field for performing fine arts students birthed the idea of Accoladi.</p>
