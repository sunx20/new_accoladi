		<p>As a high school performing musician, you know what success feels like when you have performed a difficult composition and it receives a standing ovation: or at least a standing ovation from your parents. Remember that special feeling when your ensemble received a superior rating at Festival or won a competition? And recall those moments when you as a solo performer received a superior rating at Solo and Ensemble festival, or you won your school’s or school district’s concerto contest. Those feelings are strong, vibrant, and exhilarating.
		</p>
		<p>Let’s take those feelings of success a step further up the ladder and come to the realization that the success you achieve in this area of your life may help in determining your true calling in life. Understanding yourself and that thing that excites you and gives your life purpose is your calling. When you affirm within yourself your calling, envisioning your career possibilities becomes much clearer, and this allows you to calculate the steps needed to achieve your life’s work. Research reveals the happiest people are those who have figured out who they are and have dedicated their lives to doing something they enjoy and find purpose and mission in.</p>

You need to know what you are good at, as it will help you to look in the right direction.</p>
		<p>Notice when people compliment you on different tasks that you do well. When you receive these compliments, do you feel surprised, or does it simply come naturally to you? Pay attention to the things that people say about you as it is a clear message of your skills and talents, and it will help you know which path you should consider pursuing.</p>

		<h2>Final Thoughts:</h2>
		<p>Finding your true calling in life requires you to come to a point where you know who you are, and what you want to make of yourself. The success of life is to find out what you want to do and to apply yourself to your full potential. </p>
		<p>Successful people do not feel they are working. They love what they do, and they find their career is their play. Do you love what you’re doing as a performing musician? Could this be a part of your life’s calling? Or are you good with math and music and think you’d be a great engineer. Have you thought of combining the two disciplines into one career? You have strong leadership qualities, and you also love music but you do not consider yourself as a great performer, then your life’s calling may be combining these two disciples of music and leadership to be a great CEO of a music publishing company. In fact, there are hundreds of careers in music. </p>
		<p>Now that you have an idea of what you think may be your life’s calling document it. Then think what you must do starting this very year to fulfill your life’s calling and possible career path. If college is a part of this equation, list the college major that is required for the knowledge, and often certification, that this career path requires. Then find five colleges known for this major. Where might you need to live to establish yourself in this career? For example, if you want to be a Broadway Performer then logically you are going to live in New York City, since that is the location of Broadway. Or if you want to be in the recording industry then note that the best cities for this career are Los Angeles, New York City, and Nashville. </p>

		<ul>
			<li>_____________________________ </li>
			<li>_____________________________ </li>
			<li>_____________________________ </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Then put this exercise away and every Monday morning for the next six weeks take it out and read it fully. If it excites you as much and maybe even more so than the first time you wrote it down, then maybe this is your life’s calling. </p>
		<p>If you are truly living out your life’s calling you will bring joy to yourself and to others.
