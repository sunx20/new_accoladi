		<h2 class="article-sub-title" >Types of Funding</h2>
		<p>There are a lot of ways to fund a college education. One large and under-used source is non-institutional (third-party) scholarships. Check out the terms below to learn about the different available sources and then keep scrolling to see a sample of some of the more than 16,000 non-institutional (third-party) scholarships accoladi.com documents and makes available to subscribers.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong><em>Institutional Scholarships</em></strong> are awarded by higher education institutions. These scholarships and amounts are usually based on academic merit and/or need.</li>
			<li><strong><em>Non-Institutional (third-party) Scholarships</em></strong> are awarded through the private sector. This includes non-profit organizations, corporations, employers, religious organizations, ethnic or minority organizations, talent competitions, and civic organizations. Usually the scholarship will be paid directly to the college or university. The availability of these scholarships does require research because they are not always easy to find. Colleges are not required to tell prospective students about these scholarships. And sometimes there are stipulations: in or out-of-state residences, community services, essay submissions, students’ interests and talents, or availability only to non-traditional students.</li>
			<li><strong><em>Federal Grants</em></strong> are available and do not need to be repaid. Federal Grants are based on FAFSA information and are time sensitive and limited. Federal Grants include: Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants, Teacher Education Assistance, and Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants.</li>
			<li><strong><em>Financial Aid</em></strong> is money that does not have to be paid back if it is awarded as a scholarship, grant, or federal work-study. In some cases, financial aid assistance will have to be paid back; but the stipulations are always clear from the onset.</li>
			<li><strong><em>Loans</em></strong>, whether government or private, are required to be paid back over time. Government loans are more lenient with grace periods, interest rates, interest schedules, and payment schedules than private lenders.</li>
		</ul>
