			As you prepare for choosing a college,
			a big part of your decision will be determining how to pay for it.
			There are scholarships offered by third-party organizations
			(non-institutional) which can help! Many religious organizations
			offer scholarships to active members and to those who are affiliated
			with their denomination. Some organizations that offer scholarships
			are the Presbyterian Church, the American Baptist Church, the Italian
			Catholic Federation, the Jewish Community Federation, and the Jewish
			War Veterans of the USA.

		<P>
			The Baptist General Association of
			Virginia (BGAV) has scholarships available up to $1000 per year for
			undergraduate students enrolled at an accredited  school. If you are
			an active member of a cooperating church of the Association, have the
			endorsement of the church, are a full-time student, and maintain an
			average grade of 3.0 or higher you may qualify to apply.
		</P>

			If you are planning on majoring in
			church music ministry, there are opportunities such as the Ruth K.
			Jacobs Memorial Scholarship. This scholarship is for full-time
			students who are enrolled at an accredited school as a music major
			with choral church music as a primary interest. Also available is the
			National Association of Pastoral Musicians Members Scholarship for
			students intending to work at least two years in the field of
			pastoral music following graduation from an accredited school.
		</P>

		<P>
			There are also scholarships for
			dependent children of parents who are in full-time Christian service.
			For instance, The Gaston Community Foundation of North Carolina
			offers the Jarman Family Scholarship. This $5000 scholarship is to
			help children of full-time religious ministers who are residents of
			North Carolina or South Carolina achieve an undergraduate or graduate
			degree. The recipient is chosen based on character, academic
			achievement, and need.

			Whether you plan on majoring in worship
			studies, theology, or are simply active in your church, you may
			qualify for a college scholarship offered by a religious
			organization. The eligibility criteria may differ from group to
			group, so be sure to read the eligibility requirements carefully.
