		<p>If you are a senior in high school who wishes to pursue the performing arts, you may already have mapped out your college plans. The decision is made. You have been through an audition process. You may even have heard, or will soon hear, from your desired college. But what about you juniors, sophomores and freshman? How do you get a college to notice you? Here are some tips for students, their parents and teachers, who are looking for the right college fit.</p>
		<h3>First Interaction - Let them know you are interested</h3>
		<p>Write the college, university, or conservatory a letter introducing yourself and your interest in their school. You should initially contact 1) the director of the ensemble in which you desire to play or sing and 2) the private studio instructor from whom you hope to take private lessons. </p>
		<p>Make this first connection a handwritten note sent to their physical address you can find on the school website or send it to their attention via the music department. Don’t send an email. Express your desire to attend their college and perform in their ensemble or take their private lessons. Below, you can see several sample notes that studio instructors and ensemble directors have shared with me. They will be posted under <b>Introduction Letters</b> here in the Resource Center at ScholarshipAuditions.com. </p>
		<h4>More Note-Writing Tips</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Band students who find several band directors listed, write the director of the concert band or the wind ensemble, not the marching band director. </li>
			<li>If there are several instructors for your instrument, write the one that has taught the longest.
			</li>
			<li>Don’t send the note to the Dean or the recruiter where the letter will remain filed away until your application is received. If the ensemble director and private studio instructor receive a note of interest directly from you, they will contact you right away and share your letter with the Dean and recruiter.
			</li>
			<li>It’s very important that the <b>student</b> write the letter. Parent/teacher editorial help is appreciated, but the letter should not be from the parent writing on behalf of the child. That sends the wrong message to collegiate professionals: your parent will not speak for you as a college student, and they don’t want to get notes or calls from parents. The college ensemble director and private studio instructor desires to establish a relationship with a potential future student, not the parents.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The goal of this first engagement is to get a response from the studio instructor or the ensemble director. And if you get a response from both, you’ve made a great impression. Now read on to find out more about what your second important interaction with a potential college music department can be.</p>
