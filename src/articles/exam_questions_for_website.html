		<h2>Question on a Music Department Entrance Exam at a major midwestern university:</h2>
		<h3>In American Music History what was the musical voice of the 1960’s Civil Rights Movement:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The Blind Boys of Alabama</li>
			<li>The Freedom Singers from Albany State College
			</li>
			<li>The Scottsboro Boys
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>The Answer:</h4>
		<p>The Scottsboro Boys</p>
		<h4>Reference:</h4>
		<p>The Freedom Singers originated as a student quartet formed in 1962 at Albany State College in Albany, Georgia. After folk singer Pete Seeger witnessed the power of their congregational-style of singing, which fused black Baptist a-cappella church singing with protest songs and chants, their performances drew aid and support to Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) during the emerging Civil Rights Movement. The group’s repertoire consisted of freedom songs that had been written for the movement, including “We Shall Overcome”, “We Shall Not Be Moved”, and “Keep Your Eyes on the Prize.” In 1963, the group performed at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.</p>
		<h2>Question on a Music Department Entrance Exam at a major southwestern university:</h2>
		<h3>In American Music History name the city that is the birthplace of Jazz.</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Memphis</li>
			<li>New Orleans
			</li>
			<li>St. Louis
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>The Answer:</h4>
		<p>New Orleans</p>
		<h4>Reference:</h4>
		<p>New Orleans, Louisiana is known for its strong association with jazz music, and it is universally considered to be the birthplace of the genre. The earliest form was Dixieland, which has sometimes been called traditional jazz or New Orleans jazz. However, music historians believe that jazz was a fusion of spirituals sung by slaves, Mississippi river boat music, and popular French/Spanish piano music.</p>
		<h2>Question on a Music Entrance Exam at a university in the heartland of America</h2>
		<h3>Circle the instruments that are transposing instruments:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Bb Trumpet</li>
			<li>Flute
			</li>
			<li>Bb Clarinet
			</li>
			<li>Eb Clarinet</li>
			<li>Tuba
			</li>
			<li>Piano
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>The Answer:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Bb Trumpet</li>
			<li>Bb Clarinet
			</li>
			<li>Eb Clarinet</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Reference:</h4>
		<p> A transposing instrument is a musical instrument whose music is recorded in staff notation at a pitch different from the pitch that actually sounds which is known as the concert pitch. A written middle C on a transposing instrument produces a pitch other than C, and that pitch identifies the interval of transposition when describing the instrument. For example, a written C on a Bb clarinet or a Bb trumpet sounds a concert Bb. The transposition is not a property of the instrument, but rather a convention of musical notation. Instruments whose music is typically notated in this way are called transposing instruments.</p>
		<h2>Question on a Music Entrance Exam from a Historically Black University in Atlanta:</h2>
		<h3>What is the primary musical texture of a hymn or chorale: </h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Monophonic</li>
			<li>Homophonic
			</li>
			<li>Polyphonic
			</li>
			<li>Heterophonic</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>The Answer:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Homophonic</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Reference:</h4>
		<p> Monophonic Texture – a single-line texture with no harmony (example – Plainsong / Chant)</p>
		<p>Homophonic Texture: 1) a main melody supported by chords; 2) a texture in which voices on different pitches sing the same words simultaneously (example – a Hymn)</p>
		<p>Polyphonic Texture – when two or more independent melodic lines are sounding at the same time (example – a Fugue)</p>
		<p>Heterophonic Texture – created by simultaneously varying a single melody. (It can be considered an elaborate version of Monophony and is usually associated with non-Western music and also found in Impressionistic Music orchestral compositions. (Example – “The Rite of Spring” by Igor Stravinsky)</p>

			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Reference:</h4>
		<p>Within the operatic systems of classification, there are seven basic voice types. The ranges given below are approximations.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Soprano: the highest female voice, being able to sing C4 (middle C) to C6 (high C), and possibly higher.</li>
			<li>Mezzo-Soprano: a female voice between A3 (A below middle C) and A5 (2nd A above middle C).
			</li>
			<li>Contralto: the lowest female voice, F3 (F below middle C) to E5 (2nd E above Middle C). Rare contraltos possess a range similar to the tenor.
			</li>
			<li>Countertenor: the highest male voice which takes on the characteristics of the female voice, F3 (F below middle C) to E5 (2nd E above Middle C).</li>
			<li>Tenor: the highest of natural male voice, B2 (2nd B below middle C) to A4 (A above Middle C), and possibly higher.
			</li>
			<li>Baritone: male voice, G2 (two Gs below middle C) to F4 (F above middle C).</li>
			<li>Bass: the lowest male voice, E2 (two Es below middle C) to E4 (the E above middle C).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Some men, in falsetto voice or because of certain rare physiological conditions, can sing in the same range as women. These do not fall into the female categories but are instead called “Countertenor” within classical music. </p>
		<p>Within choral music there are only four categories for adult singers. For women: soprano and alto, and for men: tenor and bass.</p>

			The <b>Grammy Award</b> is an award presented by the Recording Academy to annually recognize achievements in the music industry. The trophy depicts a gilded gramophone. The annual presentation ceremony features performances by prominent artists, and the presentation of those awards that are more popular in nature. The first Grammy Award ceremony was held on May 4, 1959. There are over 70 Grammy Award categories representing related genres of music. The most coveted categories which are not restricted by genre are as follows:

		</ul>
		<p>The <b>American Music Awards</b> is an annual American music awards show, generally held in the fall, created by Dick Clark in 1973 for ABC when the network’s contract to air the Grammy Awards expired. The nominations are selected by members of the music industry based on commercial performance, such as sales and airplay. The winners are determined by a poll of the public and fans, who can vote through the AMA's website. The following are the major general awards of the American Music Awards: <i>Artist of the Year, New Artist of the Year, Collaboration of the Year, Favorite Music Video, Top Soundtrack, and Favorite Social Artist</i>.

		<h2>Question on a Music Entrance Exam from a state university in Alabama:</h2>
		<h3>Shape-Note notation or Shape-Note singing began in what country?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>America</li>
			<li>England</li>
			<li>Ireland</li>
			<li>Denmark</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>The Answer:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li> England
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Reference:</h4>
		<p>Shape-Notes are a musical notation designed to facilitate church congregational and social singing. The notation, introduced in the late 18th century England, became a popular teaching device in American singing schools. Shapes were added to the note-heads in written music to help singers find pitches within major and minor scales without the use of more complex information found in key signatures on the staff. The idea behind shape notes is that the parts of a vocal work can be learned more quickly and easily if the music is printed in shapes that match up with the solfege syllables with which the notes of the musical scale are sung. Shape note singing is primarily practiced in the Southern United States and is still the primary singing style of congregations in northern Alabama.

		<h2>Question on a Music Entrance Exam at a religious based school in New York:</h2>
		<h3>What is the only instrument that is a combination of a wind instrument and a keyboard instrument?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Piano</li>
			<li> Celesta</li>
			<li>Organ</li>
			<li>Harpsichord</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>The Answer:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li> Organ
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Reference:</h4>
		<p>The organ is a hybrid, a combination wind instrument and keyboard instrument. It's a wind instrument because it produces sound by means of air vibrating in pipes. And it produces different notes (that is, notes of different pitch) by setting the air vibrating in pipes of different lengths: the longer the pipe, the longer the vibrating air column and the lower the pitch. The shorter the pipe, the higher the pitch. The pipes of an organ sit on a "wind chest." There are various types of organs, but they all have some mechanism to force air at steady pressure into the wind chest and from the chest into the bottoms of the pipes. To play the instrument, the organist uses keyboards and pedals. The pedals are like an extra set of keys but played with the feet. (Their function is not in any way related to that of piano pedals.) In fact the keys and pedals are really just one end of a system of valves that open and close the pipes at the bottom, allowing forced air in or shutting it out.
		</p>
		<p>But what about the "tremendous variety of sounds" an organ can produce? On a piano, the way the player depresses the keys (the "touch") determines the quality of the sound. But on an organ, this is not the case: the function of the keys is strictly to control which pipes will be opened. With certain minor exceptions (and no exceptions in the case of organ keyboards that operate electrically), the touch has nothing to do with how the notes will sound. </p>
		<p>The "how" is determined by the pipes themselves. Variations in the materials, shape, and functional design of organ pipes can produce effects ranging from subtle gradations of tone color to drastic differences in volume and character of sound. The reason the organ offers such a remarkable panoply of sounds is that many different types of pipes can be used -- separately or simultaneously -- to play the same notes. </p>
		<p>Most organ pipes are metal, some are wood. They range from the size of a pencil to monsters that are thirty-two feet (or even sixty-four feet) long and a foot and a half to two feet in diameter. The pipes are organized in sets of similar type and sound quality called "ranks," with most ranks encompassing the entire range of notes on the keyboard, one pipe per note. (Some ranks cover only the notes played by the pedals.) Most organ keyboards span sixty-one notes, and a large organ may have as many as fifty, seventy-five, or one hundred or more separate ranks. The result? Lots of pipes and lots of sounds.</p>
		<h2>Question on a Music Entrance Exam at a state university in Idaho: </h2>
		<h3>In reference to intervals from the root based on a diatonic scale: unisons, fourths, fifths, and octaves are what?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Perfect</li>
			<li>Imperfect</li>
			<li>Augmented</li>
			<li>Diminished</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>The Answer:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li> Perfect
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Reference:</h4>
		<p>Why is it Called Perfect?</p>
		<p>That is a very good question that involves more historical analysis into the times of antiquity in order to really answer it properly. The term “perfect” originated due to the musical overtone series.
		</p>
		<p>These perfect intervals ring in a way that other intervals do not. These sound qualities were first discovered and praised in the East. Pythagoras was the first person from the West to explore this interesting observation. He is responsible for incorporating it into our current musical language and practice. </p>
		<p>The label of “perfect” in addition to a number describes the interval’s <i>quality</i>. These intervals are called perfect because the ratios of their frequencies are simple whole numbers. </p>
		<h2>Question on a Music Entrance Exam at a city college in New York City: </h2>
		<h3>In musical theater there are numerous styles of songs within a staged musical performance that give the musical its characteristic style. Of the following musical theater song types, which one fits the following description: the song style is characterized by a moderate to very fast tempo and a rapid succession of rhythmic patterns where each syllable of text corresponds to one note?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Ballad</li>
			<li>Charm Number</li>
			<li>Patter Song</li>
			<li>Production Number</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>The Answer:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li> Patter Song
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Reference:</h4>
		<p>The <b>patter song</b> is characterized by a moderately fast to very fast tempo with a rapid succession of rhythmic patterns in which each syllable of text corresponds to one note. It is a staple of comic opera, especially Gilbert and Sullivan, but is also very much a part of the American musical.
		</p>
		<p>The lyrics of a patter song generally feature tongue-twisting rhyming text, with alliterative words and other consonant or vowel sounds that are intended to be entertaining to listen to at a rapid speed. The musical accompaniment is lightly orchestrated and fairly simple, to emphasize the text. The song is often intended as a showpiece for a comic character, usually a bass or baritone. </p>
		<p>Famous Patter Songs from Broadway Musicals:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> “Ya Got Trouble” - The Music Man</li>
			<li>"Now" - A Little Night Music</li>
			<li>“A Hymn to Him” - My Fair Lady</li>
