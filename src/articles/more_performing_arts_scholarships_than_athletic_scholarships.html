		<h2 class="article-sub-title" >NCAA Rules Apply to Athletes Only</h2>
		<p>If you look at a football stadium on a Saturday afternoon, it’s hard to believe that there are more performing arts scholarships than athletic scholarships. How can it even be possible? It’s because of the rules. Student athletes have a restriction that performing arts students do not: student athletes are bound by NCAA rules:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>NCAA rules determine how much scholarship money a student athlete can get. The amount is based on the college’s NCAA division and the student’s sport.</li>
			<li>Student athletes can only accept scholarships from their school. If they take scholarship money from anywhere else, they can be disqualified.</li>
			<li>The NCAA allows general academic scholarships for student athletes. About 32% of student athletes are eligible to receive these.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Non-Institutional (third-party) scholarships are key</h3>
		<p>Performing Arts students don’t have a governing body. That means they can receive scholarships from their school and from non-school sources. A non-school source is also called a non-institutional (third-party) source. It is a group that is not part of a college or university. Some examples are The American Viola Society and the Nashville Opera Guild.</p>
		<p>Some other examples of non-institutional (third-party) scholarships are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a target="_new" href="http://www.sousafoundation.net/Default.aspx?ID=35" >The John Philip Sousa Foundation Hawkins Memorial Scholarship</a></li>
			<li><a target="_new" href="https://www.youngarts.org/presidential-scholars" >The National YoungArts Foundation U.S. Presidential Scholarship</a></li>
			<li><a target="_new" href="https://www.musicforall.org/what-we-do/boa-marching-championships/grand-national-championships/scholarships" >Music for All Foundation Scholarships</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Unlike student athletes, performing arts students can get scholarships through all levels of their education, even if they decide to get a doctoral degree.</p>
		
		<h3>Performing arts students get more scholarship money</h3>
		<p>There are six performing arts students for each athletic student on U.S. college campuses. In addition, <strong>when performing arts students use all the resources available to them they receive $7 in scholarship money for every $1 student athletes receive from their institutional scholarships. </strong>That means there is more than $5 billion in scholarship money available to performing arts students every year!</p>
		<p>Unlike their restricted athletic friends, performing arts students have a lot of freedom to find and accept scholarships from many sources. That freedom makes their college education more affordable and (because they are making music) more fun.</p>
