		<ul>
			<li>Attend their concert, master class or recital. There is no better way for the ensemble director to know of your interest than to see you at their event. </li>
			<li>Drop them a note about a week before their concert and share that you will be attending.
			</li>
			<li>When the concert is over, make sure to go to the front of the stage or backstage and introduce yourself. If your parents are with you introduce your parents. Make this meeting a short introduction. This is not the time to ask 101 questions. The director has just finished conducting a long concert and is tired and wants to get to an after-concert event with friends and family. Don’t hold them up too long. You are there to make a quick, good impression and your presence has now spoken volumes to them.
			</li>
			<li>That evening, write another note. Share how much you enjoyed the concert and reiterate how much you hope to be a part of this ensemble. Let them know the year you’ll be a college freshman.
			</li>
			<li>Go on the website of the college and discover if the private studio instructor will be giving a recital or a master class. Consider attending these events. If you have to choose between the two, go to the Master Class. This will allow you to see the teaching personality of the instructors. You will see how they interact with students. Are they stern, authoritative, always the expert and talk more than listen? Or are they friendly, inviting, encouraging, engaging, funny, a good listener? Do they demonstrate command of their subject matter? What style appeals most to you will foster your growth as a musician and a future professional?</li>
			<li>Be ready to perform one of your solo compositions as a part of the Master Class by having your instrument and your solo copy and accompaniment copy of your music.
			</li>
			<li>If you must choose between attending the ensemble concert or the private instructor’s recital or master class, attend the ensemble concert. Over the years I’ve noted that the Dean, who is the decision maker for acceptance and scholarships, tends to greenlight the ensemble director’s choices more than the studio instructor. That’s because the ensemble is in the public eye and needs complete balance of instrumentation or vocal parts for a quality sounding ensemble.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You may think this seems like overkill, but according to U.S. News and World Report, four years of college can cost from $40,000 to over $140,000. Scholarships and grants can reduce this cost by 30% to 66% max. Would you personally give greater consideration to a stranger or to someone you have met and know and believe they want to be a part of your life and your success. These college ensemble directors and private instructors are the same as you and I. Their attention and goodwill will go to people they have met and have come to know.
			A goodwill investment of a few hundred dollars to meet your desired school’s gatekeepers may provide a valuable return in the form of college acceptance and scholarship consideration.
		</p>
		<p>Seriously consider combining multiple objectives on your trip. While on campus: Visit the ensemble concert and schedule a general campus tour through the admissions department. Attend the ensemble concert and let the conductor know you’ll be there. Then schedule a meeting or a private lesson with the studio instructor. Even if you must pay the private instructor’s lesson fee, it will be worth it. Here’s a sample schedule:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Leave your hometown early enough to have lunch at one of the regular student hangouts on or near campus. </li>
			<li>Take a campus tour. Schedule it with the admissions office several weeks in advance. Typically, there will be a tour with a counselor in the afternoon with a question and answer session. Take advantage of this opportunity.
			</li>
			<li>Check into your hotel and get some rest. Snoring during the concert next to the Dean is a bad look. Check out this <b>BLOG</b> on ten things you should never do on your campus visit. They’re true!
			</li>
			<li>Have dinner and dress appropriately for the concert.
			</li>
			<li>Arrive at the concert early and take your seat. Do not be late.</li>
			<li>Briefly meet the director after the concert.
			</li>
			<li>Return to the hotel and get a good night of sleep before your private lesson you scheduled for the following morning. This is not a night to party with friends from your hometown that may be attending this school.
			</li>
			<li>Wake up early for breakfast and a proper warm-up session at your hotel so you don’t take up time in the private studio.
			</li>
			<li>Dress appropriately for a first meeting with the private studio instructor, a coat and tie is overkill. Youthful, party casual will be appropriate.
			</li>
			<li>While parents go to the lobby and wait, find a place for a short warm-up. Knock on the instructor’s door at the exact time the session is scheduled. Once the lesson is over, leave a thank-you card on the stand. If lesson payment has been arranged, hand the instructor a thank-you with payment enclosed. Now you can share that your parent(s) could meet to say hello. The majority will go to the lobby to meet your parents, but don’t be concerned if not. Remember, this instructor is on a schedule, so make it brief.
			</li>
			<li>Have lunch on campus in one of the campus cafeterias or snack shops. Take a last look around.</li>
			<li>Once home, write all people you met with a personal, handwritten thank you note.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic campuses have been dealing with visits, concert attendance and private studio lessons in a variety of ways. Research and call the music department to find what their protocols are. Even if the upcoming ensemble concert is webcast, attend virtually, and write a note describing how much you enjoyed it and your desire to be a part of this ensemble in the future.
