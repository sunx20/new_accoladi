		<P>Just as pitch and rhythm are essential
		to performing a musical score, musical terms are just as critical
		since they denote the stylistic interpretation of pitch and rhythm.
		Simply put, it is the knowledge of and the ability to translate
		musical terms into sound and emotion that ultimately gives the
		performed score its musical life.  For this reason, musical terms are
		an essential aspect of testing during the audition process for
		admission and scholarship consideration in music departments and
		schools of music.  How music departments test a potential students&rsquo;
		knowledge of musical terms varies.</P>

		<P>The first and most basic testing of
		musical terms knowledge is defining a listing musical terms either in
		writing on an entrance exam or verbally to the adjudicators as a part
		of the performance aspect of the audition.  When tested verbally, the
		audition adjudicator will most often ask the potential student to
		define musical terms that are denoted in the student&rsquo;s
		performed solo and/or etude compositions.  Stories abound about a
		certain piano professor in a school of music in the Northeast who is
		renowned for taking the adjudicator&rsquo;s provided score of the
		auditioner&rsquo;s solo material and marking out the printed musical
		terms and replacing the terms of his choosing. He then hands the
		student his marked-up score with his handwritten terms and requests
		the student perform the now marked-up solo with these new musical
		terms.	</P>

		<P>Research shows that some schools of
		music list musical terms in a random order and request they be put in
		matching categories and in a progressive order within those
		categories.  An example from an entrance exam from a school of music
		in the Midwest: Dynamics, Andante, Tenor, Forte, Pianissimo, Grave,
		Soprano, Mezzo-Piano, Moderato, Lento, Alto, Tempo Markings,
		Fortississimo, Allegro, Baritone, Piano, Presto, Voice Parts,
		Fortissimo, Adagio, Bass, Mezzo-Forte, Pianississimo, and Vivace.
		</P>

		<P>The correct answer would be:</P>
		<table class="table">
			<tr>
				<th>Dynamics</th>
				<th>Voice Parts</th>
				<th>Tempo Markings</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Pianississimo</td>
				<td>Soprano</td>
				<td>Grave</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Pianissimo</td>
				<td>Alto</td>
				<td>Lento</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Piano</td>
				<td>Tenor</td>
				<td>Adagio</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Mezzo-Piano</td>
				<td>Baritone</td>
				<td>Andante</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Mezzo-Forte</td>
				<td>Bass</td>
				<td>Moderato</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Forte</td>
				<td></td>
				<td>Allegro</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Fortissimo</td>
				<td></td>
				<td>Vivace</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Fortississimo</td>
				<td></td>
				<td>Presto</td>
			</tr>

		<P>Most often the adjudicator wants to
		know if the potential student can apply the musical terms with the
		correct interpretation within the context of a performance.  A West
		Coast school of music combines the testing of musical terms and
		sightreading.  The potential student is handed three sightreading
		examples.  There are distinct similarities in each of these three
		examples as all have the same meter, rhythmic patterns, and
		intervals.  Each example is in a different key, and the musical terms
		are different in each example.  In this case, the school is looking
		for the student&rsquo;s ability to show how the musical
		interpretation (and key) delineates one musical example from the
		others.</P>

		<P>As you study and prepare for your
		audition, remember, pitch and rhythm in a musical score are
		essential.  But the understanding of and the ability to appropriately
		apply the knowledge of musical terms is just as essential for a
		musical performer. Without question, musical terms will be a part of
		the collegiate audition process.  Be sure you are prepared.</P>
