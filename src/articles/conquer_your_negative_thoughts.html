		<p>Are you reaching your performance goals? Or maybe your most immediate goal is getting into college, university, or a conservatory program. Is your practice time helping you achieve that goal? Is there an elusive cadenza that’s not falling right in your fingers? A melismatic motif or riff that’s just not natural for your voice? Or a sticking pattern you must master to make a DCI drumline, that is not happening? </p>
		<p>After practicing day after day and things don’t come together, do you begin to hear negative voices in your head? We’ve all heard them: “<i>You’ll never be able to do this</i>.” Or, “<i>Screw this, it’s too hard and I have better things to do</i>!” The one that creeps into my head is, “<i>There are other people already so much better than you and you’ll never catch up. Let it go!</i>”</p>
		<p>If you want to succeed, you must learn to deal with the negative voices. Not just as a developing musician, but in every area of your life. These negative voices can come from rivals, even friends and family. But it is the voice inside your head that is the most difficult to overcome. Get that negativity out of your head, because most of us are our own worst critics. Shutting down that voice allows your confidence, self-esteem, and energy to flow and to be powerful.</p>
		<p>We can't always make that pessimistic voice disappear completely, but we can diminish it, so it doesn’t completely drive our actions. Here are seven effective tips I’ve learned for getting that negative voice out of my head:</p>
		<h3>Number One – Acknowledge the Thought</h3>
		<p>Rather than try to push the thought out of your head, acknowledge that it has spoken. But don’t let that be the only thought in your head. You have the power to change negativity with positive thoughts. So, write down what this negative voice speaks. Add the positive words, “I am an overcomer!” Text it and read it to yourself. Then delete the negative text and read what remains, “I am an overcomer!”</p>
		<h3>Number Two – “The Double Standard Method”</h3>
		<p>Most often, we are a lot harder on ourselves than we are with other people. So next time the negative voice crops up, try treating yourself with the same courtesy that you would a good friend. Talk to yourself the way you would talk to that friend. We judge ourselves very harshly but are more compassionate toward others. Remember you are important enough to deserve your own compassion.</p>
		<h3>Number Three – Try Thought Stopping</h3>
		<p>I have a three-step method that works for me: First, say, or I usually yell, in my own mind 'STOP!' immediately when I hear this menacing voice. Second, I take 3 deep abdominal breaths. Third, I envision myself as the calm, strong, and self-assured person I know can be. Not only do I envision this image, I speak it back to myself: I am a calm, strong, and self-assured person.</p>
		<h3>Number Four – Sing the Thought</h3>
		<p>Yes, “<i>Sing the Thought</i>.” Put on your Selena, Legend, Beyonce, Lamar, Lizzo, Bieber, Snoop Dog, J Cole, Taylor, Elvis, or your favorite Bruno Mars voice and sing out loud that negative thought. I’ve found that when singing a distressing thought, it sounds silly, and diminishes the usual negative emotional reaction.</p>
		<h3>Number Five – Name Your Negative Voice</h3>
		<p>Give your negative voice a name. I call mine 'Ethel,' and tell her that she can come along for the ride, but she can't drive the car. Negative feelings like fear, worry, anger, or self-criticism may enter your head, but they don't have to decide where you go and what you do when you get there. ‘Ethel’ is often along for the ride, but I can put her in the back seat.</p>
		<h3>Number Six – Immediately Add a Positive ‘AND’ at the End of Any Negative Thought </h3>
		<p>When you have a negative thought, immediately pair it with a positive ‘and.’ For example, "<i>I completely messed that 2nd Movement up and I am confident I’ll have a better performance the next time</i>.” Or “<i>I hate this school and I have the strength to figure out how to create a new path and friends for me in this place</i>.” Pairing a negative with a positive ending does two important things in our brain: first, it reminds us that we are in control of our thinking, and we can shape our day by shaping our thinking. Second, we begin to trigger, more often those neurons that elevate optimism, positive self-regard, and creativity.</p>
		<h3>Number Seven – Share Your Thoughts with Someone</h3>
		<p>When that negative voice is running away with your thoughts, it can lead you to make bad decisions. Instead, call a friend you can trust and ask if you can borrow their clear mind for a minute. Their suggestions may not be perfect, but when you hear another voice, other thoughts, you are introduced to new choices. </p>
		<h4>Remember . . .</h4>
		<p>We all struggle with that cruel, negative voice from time to time. Use these techniques to banish those thoughts as much as possible. You are what you think you are. You know that you are a winner. You can master any difficult musical problem with time, practice, and steadfast persistence. You are filled with the strength and determination to achieve your goals. Most importantly remember, Ethel is in the back seat. Oh, just put her out of the car – now!</p>
