		<p>Hello Fellow Makers and Supporters of Makers, </span></p>
		<p>Sarah Ellis here. accoladi.com ambassador and Producer/Co-Creator of a production company <a target="_new" style="color:maroon; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.mtshorts.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1605199576971000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1CmiRJp4urNltrh7gEzUkv">MT Shorts</a>, which gives voice to an emerging generation of creatives through original musical short films. </p>
		<p>My Co-Creator Greg Kamp and I had this little nugget of an idea back in 2018. We felt the current model of getting new work seen was broken. Innate risks &amp; challenges having to mount full productions, readings, or concerts were really plaguing up and coming creatives. So we came up with something totally new - a calling card to get their works seen on a larger scale: enter original musical short films.</p>

			<br/><span style="font-size:9px; color: gray;">( Still from MT Short&rsquo;s musical short film STILL HERE, written by Roseberry &amp; Klose. )</span></p>
		<p>It&rsquo;s two years later, and, unfortunately, the current model is ACTUALLY broken. Broadway&rsquo;s lights are dimmed, and theaters are shuttered around the country, with no definite relief in sight. </p>
		<p>But back in March 2020, when the world shut down, and our shows got cancelled, Greg called me with an idea. We were to create an original musical film shot entirely socially distancedly, told from the first-person perspective of a computer screen. We&rsquo;d follow a cursor adding bottles of wine to a check-out cart, scrolling through Facebook, typing emojis in a group chat, erupting into Facetime Duets, and ultimately, entering the Reighdell High 10 Year Class Reunion &lsquo;Now On Zoom.&rsquo; </p>
		<p>Four original songs-penned from the brilliant mind of Drew Fornarola (Veggie Tales, STRAIGHT)-over 50 performers across 15 states, 60 computers recording said 50 performers, a full string section recording from their respective homes, and MANY, MANY HOURS lining up and syncing footage, later...we have an original musical short film that was made in quarantine and for quarantine. </p>
		<p>BUT, how were we to premiere it? How were we to gather all our cast and crew and creative and friends and family to celebrate this extremely unique and timely piece when&hellip;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;A reformed choir nerd with mild social anxiety (played by Frozen&rsquo;s Female Olaf, Ryann Redmond, is unwillingly thrust into a blast from her past when her ten-year class reunion goes (sung) VIRUTAAAL.&rdquo; </p>
		<p>Enter stage right like Elphaba ascending, the game-changing technology that is a virtual venue, aptly named <a target="_new" style="color:maroon; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.alltogethernow.ie/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1605199576972000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2zBVWSF4BJoKQGYMEChCvX">All Together Now</a>. Created by theatre tech-evangelist (her fabulous words, not mine) Jessica Ryan, CEO of <a target="_new" style="color:maroon; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.broadwayunlocked.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1605199576972000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2JKzmhaPpuRU4rnH3uka3z">Broadway Unlocked</a>&nbsp;(its sister innovative theatre-tech company), All Together Now is a curated live event space that simulates the theatre-going experience&nbsp;we&rsquo;ve been craving for the past eight months, from the comfort and safety of our homes. </p>
		<p>The space is set up to feel like you&rsquo;re actually in a theatre. You arrive in the &lsquo;lobby&rsquo; and are ushered through to different virtual rooms, guided by instructions in the ongoing LIVE chat. From heading to the virtual bar, a sort of chat roulette where you are destined to make a new connection, to entering different breakout rooms designed to engage patrons (ie fireside chats, a resident mixologist mixing up a cocktail, live DJ spinning through your screen) to video chatting with friends at your VIP table pre-show, BU has created a space that is reinventing the way we gather together to celebrate in a virtual world, reminiscent of the times of old. </p>
		<p>Needless to say, their stats are pretty impressive. It should be noted this is from October-they&rsquo;ve had events almost every night in November. Take a look: </p>

		<p>They have truly cracked the formula to keep people ENGAGED in an online event far beyond a typical live-stream, and they&rsquo;re connecting our world globally, in a time when we&rsquo;re all so far apart.</p>
		<p>For the world premiere of High School Zoomsical&nbsp;happening on Sunday, November 15th, we are customizing our virtual venue to look like the hallways of Reighdell High, where the virtual rooms will be &lsquo;classrooms.&rsquo; Chemistry will host a mixologist instructing patrons live on how to craft the signature cocktail of the evening. History will be live trivia hosted by Broadway stars. English class will be a moderated conversation between current MT Shorts composers on the process of writing for screen...all before patrons head to &lsquo;The Stage&rsquo; for a LIVE Broadcast where the host is able to engage directly with patrons and talent, and where pre-recorded and live content meet. </p>
		<p>Does this sound awesome? It&rsquo;s because it is. I&rsquo;ve now attended a few events in All Together Now, and each one is totally unique, designed with the intention of the goals of the client in mind. I haven&rsquo;t even mentioned the ways ATN is leveraging media sponsorships for their clients through their interactive virtual expo booths&hellip;.but instead of me going on about it, why don&rsquo;t you just come and experience it yourself? </p>
		<p>Join us THIS SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 15th at 7 PM EST.&nbsp;Classrooms open at 7 PM, Live Broadcast at 7:30, and the World Premiere of MT Short&rsquo;s High School Zoomsical&nbsp;at 8 PM. </p>
		<p>ADMISSION IS FREE&nbsp;with required registration&nbsp;(to send you the link to the venue) at <a target="_new" style="color:maroon; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://mtshorts.com/signup&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1605199576974000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2fz2H8qNhlZX-DF6yE8YP1">MTSHORTS.COM/SIGNUP</a>. </p>
		<p>See you there!</p>
