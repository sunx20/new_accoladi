		<p>A degree is a credential one receives after completing a course of study. During the course of study, the student is in pursuit of obtaining a Bachelor of Arts, a Bachelor of Science, a Bachelor of Fine Arts, or even a Bachelor of Music*.</p>
		<p>Majors express the primary focus subject a collegiate student is studying in pursuit of a degree. Whereas a Bachelor of Music is a degree, the major could be composition, instrumental music education, musicology, or viola performance. For example, the complete degrees major name might be Bachelor of Music in Composition.

		<h3>Difference between a Major and a Minor</h3>
		<p>For a Bachelor’s Degree a major is a primary focus of study and a minor is a secondary focus of study. Majors are typically chosen to compliment a student’s career goal, and a minor may be chosen to enhance the major. For example, a music major student receiving a Bachelors in Contemporary Music with a Minor in Songwriting.

		<h3>Difference between a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree and a Bachelor of Arts degree</h3>
		<p>In a nutshell, a Bachelor of Arts (BA) is deemed as a more general degree while a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) is considered as more of a professional specialized qualification. Most often both the BFA and the BA is dedicated to performers.
		</p>
		<p>When the prospective student imagines studying performance in higher education, they probably picture a BFA-granting institution like the Oberlin Conservatory of Music or the Juilliard School. Bachelor of Fine Arts programs like these turn pre-professionals into professionals by immersing them in their craft, usually for four years. These programs seek to take the highest quality prospects possible and team them with top-tier instructors to create a rigorous environment. The BFA follows a trade-school paradigm: in the same way programs train welders to weld, doctors to practice medicine, or software engineers to program, conservatories train performers for performance.</p>
		<p>When the prospective student pictures the college experience, they likely imagine a BA program like those found at the University of Texas at Austin, Vanderbilt University, and Amherst College where Bachelor of Arts programs emphasize education across the arts in more general studies. In addition to studio classes the BA degree requires coursework in humanities, quantitative reasoning, foreign language, and other competencies. These BA students will study the history and philosophy of their chosen art form, they may have opportunities to study abroad, and they will engage in general reading and writing. BA performance programs teach students to become critical thinkers as well as artists.

		<h3>Difference between a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Bachelor of Science degree
		</h3>
		<p>Generally, a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree focuses on the humanities and arts while a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree emphasizes math and science. Thus, the primary difference between the two types of degrees is the focus of the coursework students are required to complete to earn them.</p>
		<p>Programs resulting in a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree are generally more strictly focused on their subject matter. Students are expected to concentrate their academic energies on mastering the technical and practical facets of their field. They have fewer opportunities to explore topics outside of the subject of their major.</p>
		<p>A Bachelor of Arts degree program provides students with a more expansive education, requiring fewer credits that are directly linked to a particular major. Instead, students are expected to earn credits in a variety of liberal arts subjects. Courses in the humanities, English, the social sciences, and a foreign language are typically part of this degree program. Students can pick and choose from a broad array of courses to fulfill these requirements, allowing them greater flexibility to customize their education to match their individual goals and interests.</p>
		<p><b>*Bachelor of Music</b> – This degree is almost identical to a Bachelor of Fine Arts as its program of study turns pre-professionals into professionals by immersing them in their craft and highlights the performance proficiency of each student mainly as a soloist over an ensemble member. This degree is most often granted in a conservatory setting.</p>
