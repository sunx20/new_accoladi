			Thanks for sharing this time with me. I’m Randall Bayne, the Founder and CEO of accoladi.com.
		</p>

		<p>
			I have been speaking for years  to young people, and their parents and teachers, who are looking for the right college fit. 
			And over time I have discovered that process is very similar to the process of dating. 
			It’s March and the vast majority of seniors know their college path by now. 
			The decision is made, they have been through the audition process. Some have heard from their desired colleges and others will know soon. 
			Their dating season is finished and they are about to tie the knot.
		</p>

		<p>
			But what about you present juniors, sophomores, and freshman?
			How do you get a college to notice you? Let’s discuss some tips on the art of dating.
		</p>

		<h3>How to make a First Date</h3>
		<p>
			Step one, they have to know you’re interested.
			It’s like passing that note in class... I like you... Do you like me?
		</p>
		<p>
			Write the college, university, or conservatory a letter introducing yourself and your interest in their school. 
			There are two specific people at this school you should contact initially: the ensemble director you desire to play or sing in and the private studio instructor you hope to take private lessons from. 
		</p>
		<p>
			And write them a handwritten note, not an email, expressing your desire to attend their college and perform in their ensemble or take private lessons from them. 
			Later, I will post several of these notes that studio instructors and ensemble directors have shared with me. 
			They will be posted under <b><u>Introduction Letters</u></b> in the Resource Center at accoladi.com. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Some more tips: First, if you are a band student and you see several band directors listed, write the director of the concert band or the wind ensemble, not the marching band director. 
			Second, if there are several instructors for your instrument, write the one that has taught the longest. 
			And, again, your note should be handwritten or typed and sent to the physical address of the director and studio. 
			You can find their address on the school website or send it to their attention via the music department.
		</p>
		<p>
			Third, don’t send the note to the Dean or the recruiter. 
			It will be much better if the ensemble director and private studio instructor knows of your interest. 
			I can promise you they will walk up the hall and share your letter with the Dean and recruiter. 
			My experience is if it goes to the dean or recruiter first, the letter will stay in a file until you submit an application... whereas the ensemble director and private studio instructor will work to stay in contact right away. 
		</p>
		<p>
			And four, the student must write the letter. 
			Parent and teacher help with editing will always be appreciated. 
			But the letter should not be from the parent “I’m writing this letter on behalf of my child” That sends the wrong messages to these collegiate professionals: your parent will not speak for you as a college freshman, and they don’t want to get calls from parents. 
			The college ensemble director and private studio instructor desires to establish a relationship with a potential future <i>student</i>, not a student’s parents.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let’s review….
		</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The first and best way to let a college, university or conservatory know you are interested is to write the ensemble you wish to perform in and the private studio instructor you hope to take lessons from. </li>
				<li>Send a handwritten or typed letter not an email.</li>
				<li>The letter should come from the student, not the student’s parent.</li>
			</ol>

		<p>
			The best advice for dating is that the goal of the first date is to get the second date. 
			You’ve got the second date if you get a response from the studio instructor or the ensemble director. 
			And if you get a response from both, you’ve made a great impression on this first date.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, what should the second date look like?
		</p>
		
		<h3>Second Date</h3>
		<p>
			Attend their next concert, master class, or recital. There is no better way for the ensemble director to know of your interest in their program than to see you at their.
			Drop them a note about a week before their concert and share that you will be attending. 
			And when the concert is over, make sure to go to the front of the stage or backstage and introduce yourself.
			If your parents are with you introduce your parents. 
			Make this meeting a short introduction: “Enjoyed the concert.  Hope someday to be a part of this ensemble.” 
			And so on. 
			That’s it... no more. And parents
			this is not the time to ask 101 questions. 
			The director has just finished conducting a long concert, he or she is tired and wants to get to an after-concert event with friends and family. 
			Don’t hold them up too long. You are there to make a quick, good impression and your presence has now spoken volumes to them.
		</p>
		<p>
			That evening, write the director a note again, sharing how very much you enjoyed the concert and then reiterate how much you hope to be a part of this ensemble in. 
			Fill in the year that you’ll be a college freshman.
		</p>
		<p>
			You may also want to go on the website of the college that
			has your interest and view the upcoming performance schedule to see if the private
			studio instructor will be giving a recital or a master class. If so, then consider attending one or both of
			these events. If you have to choose between the two go to the Master Class. The
			Master Class will allow you to see the teaching personality of the instructor.
			You will see how he or she interacts with students - - are they stern,
			authoritative, always the expert, and talk more than listen or are they
			friendly, inviting, encouraging, engaging, funny, a good listener. Do they
			demonstrate command of the subject they are presenting? The question is what
			style will best foster your growth as a musician and a future professional in
			your chosen field. Also be ready to
			perform one of your solo compositions as a part of the Master Class by having
			your instrument and your solo copy and accompaniment copy of your music with
			you.
		</p>
		<p>
			You may think this sounds like a good idea only if the college, university or conservatory is within a short drive of my hometown. Otherwise, I’ll pass. Let’s look at this again.  
			According to U.S. News and World Report, four years of college can cost from $40,000 to $140,000 or more. 
			Scholarships and grants can reduce this cost by 30% to 66% approximately. 
		</p>
		<p>
			So, if it cost you around a few hundred dollars to travel to
			your potential collegiate home and meet their greatest influencers, that might prove to be the best goodwill
			investment you could make in the pursuit of college acceptance and scholarship consideration.
		</p>
		<p>
			Would you personally give greater consideration to a stranger or to someone you have met and know and believe they want to be a part of your life and your success. 
			These college ensemble directors and private instructors are no different than you and I. 
			Their attention and goodwill will go to people they have met and have come to know.
		</p>
		<p>
			So, here is some seasoned advice about attending a scheduled concert, master class, or recital on the campus of the college, university, or conservatory you are.
			interested in:
		</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Do it! That’s right, simply do it. The
				benefits and possibilities are far reaching.</li>
				<li>If you must choose between attending the
				ensemble concert or the private instructors recital or master class. Attend the
				ensemble concert. Over the years I’ve noted that the Dean, who is the decision
				maker for acceptance and scholarships, tends to greenlight the ensemble
				director’s choices more than the studio instructor. That’s because the ensemble
				is in the public eye and needs complete balance of instrumentation or vocal
				parts for a quality sounding ensemble.</li>
				<li>If you must choose between attending the private
				studio instructors recital or Master Class as stated earlier attend the Master
				Class.</li>
			</ol>

		<p>
			Final thought on this subject, consider combining multiple objectives on your trip. 
			While on campus:  Visit the ensemble concert and schedule a general campus tour through the admissions department. 
			Attend the ensemble concert and let the conductor know you’ll be there. 
			Then schedule a meeting or a private lesson with the studio instructor. 
			Even if you must pay the private instructor’s lesson fee, it will be worth it. 
			Here’s a schedule:
		</p>


		<ol>
			<li>
				Leave your hometown earlier enough if flying to get to the college town before lunch. 
				Drive around town and the campus and google the off-campus restaurant that is one of the hangouts for students on this campus and have lunch there. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Go back to campus for a tour. 
				Note that the campus tour should be scheduled weeks in advance with the admission department.
				There is usually only one tour in the afternoon followed by a question and answer session with an admissions counselor. 
				Take advantage of this opportunity.
			</li>
			<li>
				Next check into your hotel and get some rest. 
				Snoring during the concert as you sit next to the Dean, the director’s wife - you may think I’m kidding but I’m not. 
				I’ve heard stories of prospective students and parents having done things just like this. 
				I have a blog on ten things you should never do on your campus visit. 
				These are real things that people have actually done. 
				Some are stunning while others are downright hilarious.
			</li>
			<li>OK. Next, have dinner and dress appropriately for the concert</li>
			<li>Arrive at the concert early and take your seat --- Do not be late</li>
			<li>Follow the instructions previously shared in how to make contact with the director following the concert. Remember, brevity is most important. </li>
			<li>
				Return to the hotel and get a good night of sleep, hopefully for a scheduled private lesson you made for following morning.
				This is not a night to party with friends from your hometown that may be attending this school.
			</li>
			<li>Wake up early for breakfast and a proper pre-warm-up session at your hotel so you don’t take too much time in the private studio for warm-up.</li>
			<li>Dress appropriately for a first meeting with the private studio instructor, a coat and tie is overkill. Youthful party casual will be appropriate.</li>
			<li>
				Arrive early on the campus, find a place for a short warm-up. 
				Parents should go to the lobby and wait, the student should knock on the door of the private instructor at the exact time the session is scheduled. 
				Once the lesson is over, leave a thank-you card on the stand and if lesson payment has been arranged, hand the instructor a thank-you with payment enclosed. 
				At this you can share that your parent(s) could meet to say hello. 
				Do not be dismayed if the instructor cannot meet them but, the majority will go to the lobby to meet your parents. 
				Remember, this instructor is on a set schedule so make it brief.
			</li>
			<li>Have lunch on campus in one of the campus cafeterias or snack shops. Don’t forget that this is institutional food and you may not like it. In fact, it could color your opinion of the campus and its instructors!</li>
			<li>Once home, make sure to write all people you met with a personal, handwritten thank you note.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			Now we must take into account that this is a COVID-19 year and every campus is dealing with campus visits, concert attendance, and private studio lessons in a myriad of ways. 
			Research and call the music department to find what their protocol is in reference to COVID-19. 
			Even if the upcoming ensemble concert is virtual, attend the concert, and then write a note stating your attendance, your desire to be a part of this ensemble in the coming years, and how much you enjoyed the concert.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are pleased with how this second date has gone you may want to consider a third date. 
			I have to tell you that many people skip first and second dates and move straight to the third date. 
			I see nothing wrong with leaving out dates one and two if the timing of the year moves you a more aggressive schedule.
		</p>

		<h3>Here is my advice on……Date Number Three</h3>
		<p>
			Attend a summer camp or summer stock, extended master class or some summer enrichment experience on the college campus that you are hoping to attend. 
			This is the best way for extended exposure of the college ensemble director or show director so they get to know you and for you to get to know them and their style of instructing. 
			These camps on college campuses are usually for one week and sometimes two. 
			The longer the camp the better the opportunity to establish a long-term relationship. 
			If it’s longer than a week there is a greater opportunity to take at least one or two private lessons from the studio instructor you are most interested in.
		</p>
		<p>
			In some states there are All-State training camps, especially All-State chorus training camps. 
			Most often these camps are led by high school teachers which does not guarantee the exposure to the college ensemble director or the college studio instructor. 
			However, research reveals that these camps really do help the All-State auditioning student have an advantage in the All-State audition process. 
			And making All-State is paramount in catching the attention of a music department college recruiter. 
			So, this is a good thing.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are other multi-week camps from four to even nine weeks. 
			Some are Governor’s School of the Arts summer sessions in your state and others are nationally noted camps, academies, or summer conservatories that require an expanded application and an audition for consideration. 
			These camps offer exceptional benefits especially when it comes to collegiate and scholarship opportunities. 
			It is from these kinds of camps that college, university, and conservatory recruiters scout for students.
			Almost all of these camps offer a college day or fair, or even a college weekend in order for recruiters and high caliber students to interact. 
		</p>
		<p>
			There is much to be said about these summer camps and
			especially extended week camps and the influence they have on recruiters and
			the role they have historically played in students being accepted into some of
			America’s most noted collegiate programs and the associated scholarship potential. 
			I will make this the subject of my next webinar.
		</p>
		<p>
			I want to recap my dating advice for college to you:
		</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Let them know you’re interested in them. And if they reply with a note of interest on their part, follow this up with a note of thanks.</li>
				<li>Set a date to meet them in the context of a future experience that you will share together. This shared experience could be you performing in one of their ensembles and/or you taking private lessons in their studio.</li>
				<li>Spend more time with them than just one evening or day. Extended time will help solidify the relationship. </li>
			</ol>

		<p>
			Whatever phase of connection you find yourself in a good place to be because you have demonstrated your courage and conviction to start the process. 
			My final thoughts are... you go... go and get that dream... turn that dream into your desired reality. 
			You will do that by beginning and then establishing positive relationships, and positive relationships will always be rewarding.
